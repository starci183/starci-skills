# Execute `fe/learning-resolve`

This operator's responsibility is to resolve approved learning requests into the correct durable authority or an explicit local-only verdict. Its input, output, loaded bindings, worker observations, drafts, and evidence exist only inside the current task session.

## Step 1 — Validate and freeze the invocation

**Read:** the complete input object only.
**Context:** none; do not resolve any binding before validation succeeds.
**Decision evidence:** accepted `stage/status`, required and forbidden facts, task ownership of every session URI, and orchestration profile identity.
**Action:** run `validate-input.mjs` and freeze the route, provided references, load declarations, and session slots.
**Session write:** the validated envelope at `payload.session.inputRef`.
**Durable write:** none.
**Stop:** emit the operator's blocked or refusal decision when validation fails; a single-outcome operator stops the parent skill as invalid input rather than inventing another route.
**Orchestration:** coordinator only.

## Step 2 — Load business authority

**Read:** `payload.loads.business` and `payload.provided.businessHeadRef`.
**Context:** load exactly the declared revision under `.worktrees/<project>/businesses/`; never infer business behavior from frontend source.
**Decision evidence:** reference equality, revision hash, accepted business status, and the specific facts needed to resolve approved learning requests into the correct durable authority or an explicit local-only verdict.
**Action:** normalize only the applicable actor, outcome, rule, state, and constraint references.
**Session write:** value-safe business bindings under `scratchPrefix/business`; do not copy the complete business document into output.
**Durable write:** none.
**Stop:** stop when the business head is missing, stale, rejected, or does not equal the provided reference.
**Orchestration:** coordinator owns authority selection; workers cannot choose another business head.

## Step 3 — Resolve upstream, knowledge, and source capability

**Read:** `payload.loads.upstream`, `payload.loads.knowledge`, and every source binding declared by this schema.
**Context:** resolve only learning-request batch, source acceptance evidence, and approved authority boundary. Retrieve only the listed knowledge IDs at their pinned content hashes. Resolve `payload.loads.frontendSource` only: the hash-pinned plain-JSON contract snapshot, generator fingerprint, selected query IDs, and pinned index generation. Never load raw repository material or broaden the contract query. Resolve only `exactTargets` after validating repository-relative paths and SHA-256 values.
**Decision evidence:** upstream identity and revision matches, knowledge generation matches, and every requested capability or exact target is inside the frozen boundary.
**Action:** create a minimal constraint set containing IDs, revisions, applicable rules, target permissions, and required outcomes.
**Session write:** normalized constraints at `scratchPrefix/constraints`.
**Durable write:** none.
**Stop:** stop on unresolved ownership, contradictory accepted evidence, stale authority hash, or a cross-boundary update.
**Orchestration:** bindings are resolved once by the coordinator and passed to workers as minimal read-only slices.

## Step 4 — Perform the operator decision

**Read:** normalized business and authority constraints plus only the exact source-capability records or targets declared above.
**Context:** do not load another feature, knowledge record, contract generation, file, service, or provider target.
**Decision evidence:** Compare each request with existing Grammar, Principle, pattern, gate, and local source ownership. Select extend, create, reject, or local-only and prepare the smallest authority delta.
**Action:** execute that classification or preparation and attach evidence by stable input identity; record applied rules and observable conclusions, never hidden reasoning.
**Session write:** a normalized draft at `scratchPrefix/learning-resolve-draft`.
**Durable write:** none at this step.
**Stop:** stop on unresolved ownership, contradictory accepted evidence, stale authority hash, or a cross-boundary update.
**Orchestration:** Workers may analyze disjoint request IDs read-only. The coordinator joins by proposed authority identity, resolves collisions, and alone writes approved authority targets.

## Step 5 — Verify and commit the accepted result

**Read:** the normalized draft, joined worker observations, frozen constraints, and expected emitted facts.
**Context:** no new context may be loaded during verification.
**Decision evidence:** Prove the resolution has one owner, a negative boundary, non-duplicated identity, and evidence that distinguishes reusable law from project-specific behavior.
**Action:** validate completeness, conflict freedom, boundary compliance, and decision-to-route mapping. The coordinator rejects missing worker IDs or conflicting observations before any effect.
**Session write:** accepted evidence and before/after descriptors under `scratchPrefix/accepted-result`.
**Durable write:** The coordinator writes only the exact approved targets after a final hash check; no receipt or draft is durable.
**Stop:** stop on unresolved ownership, contradictory accepted evidence, stale authority hash, or a cross-boundary update.
**Orchestration:** coordinator-only join and commit; workers remain read/analyze-only and cannot mutate source or external systems.

## Step 6 — Emit output and register terminal cleanup

**Read:** accepted result, minimal context lineage, emitted facts, and all allocated scratch references.
**Context:** references and revisions actually used only; omit copied documents, prompts, worker transcripts, and reasoning.
**Decision evidence:** selected decision exactly matches one manifest emit, `payload.state`, root stage/status, and facts additions/removals.
**Action:** construct `output.schema.json`, validate it with `validate-output.mjs`, and place it at `payload.session.outputRef`.
**Session write:** output, evidence refs, and complete cleanup inventory.
**Durable write:** none.
**Stop:** do not emit an invalid or partially joined output.
**Orchestration:** the coordinator emits once. At every parent-skill terminal, purge input, output, loaded bindings, worker observations, drafts, evidence, and receipts.
