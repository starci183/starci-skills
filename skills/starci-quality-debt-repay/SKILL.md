# starci-quality-debt-repay

Use to repay one declared and approved quality-debt item through a measured progress loop. Do not use for ordinary findings, diagnosis, readiness inventory, or feature delivery.

## INPUT ANALYSIS

Require the ephemeral global selection, read `input.md`, validate `input.schema.json`, then follow local `analyze-input.md`. This skill owns one flow with fixed first state `debt-approval`; local analysis only validates and normalizes scope without loading operator knowledge.

## STATE MACHINE

Execute `machine.json` through `execute.md`. Branches and loops are machine-owned; operators never invoke one another. Stop at waits for the exact displayed revision and finish only at a terminal. Purge all intermediates at every terminal while preserving approved durable mutations.

## CONTEXT CONTRACT

| State or phase | Allowed | Forbidden |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `diagnosis or inventory` | declared command fingerprints, cached green receipts and exact failing evidence | unrelated source, broad Qdrant and speculative fixes |
| `approval` | one finding/debt identity, baseline, boundary and approval hash | source bodies and other findings |
| `repair` | only approved exact files and narrow repair law | scope expansion, unrelated findings and whole-repository scans |
| `verification + loop` | independent proof, prior fingerprint, loop counter and residual identity | stale observations and reloaded unrelated context |

## LOADS

| Alias | Target | Kind | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@selection` | global `/analyze-input.md` output | task-session | bind prompt intent directly to this one-flow skill |
| `@machine` | `machine.json` | file | executable state-machine graph |
| `@analysis` | `analyze-input.md` | file | local validation and normalization before operator load |
