# starci-backend-delivery

Use to plan, approve, implement, test, and prove one new backend delivery from current business authority. Do not use for a pre-approved repair, frontend work, standalone diagnosis, or deployment.

## INPUT ANALYSIS

Require the ephemeral global selection, read `input.md`, validate `input.schema.json`, then follow local `analyze-input.md`. This skill owns one flow with fixed first state `route`; local analysis only validates and normalizes scope without loading operator knowledge.

## STATE MACHINE

Execute `machine.json` through `execute.md`. Branches and loops are machine-owned; operators never invoke one another. Before an architecture approval wait, read and apply `../../operators/architecture/review-widget.md`; `architecture/decision-challenge` must emit a validated HTML preview and the host must render it through `visualize` before requesting `OK ARCHITECTURE`. Stop at waits for the exact displayed revision and finish only at a terminal. Purge all intermediates at every terminal while preserving approved durable mutations.

## CONTEXT CONTRACT

| State or phase | Allowed | Forbidden |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `route + freshness` | route, source commit, authority and coding-context hash metadata | business bodies, raw source and Qdrant bodies |
| `architecture + boundary planning` | exact business projection, canonical coding-context records and narrow operator knowledge | raw source files, whole indexes and unrelated modules |
| `approval + coding-scope freeze` | plan hash, source HEAD and exact target path/hash headers | file bodies and repository scans |
| `implementation` | approved boundary, exact frozen files and be.implementation knowledge | undeclared files, broad Qdrant and adjacent business |
| `quality + proof + reconcile` | changed-file receipts, declared commands, frozen pre-delivery receipt and immutable proof | new design context and unfrozen source discovery |
