# Execute starci-deployment

1. Accept only a validated global `selection` for this skill, validate the complete input, run local `analyze-input`, then enter fixed state `route`.
2. Load only the current state's operator contract. That operator alone retrieves its declared Qdrant knowledge.
3. Validate operator input, execute it, validate output, then route through exactly one matching edge.
4. Keep selection, operator data, context, observations, plans and receipts in task-session memory only. On a loop, compare the prior fingerprint, reuse approved identities and reload only the re-entered operator. Block repeated no-progress fingerprints.
5. Wait states stop before irreversible work and accept only the displayed revision or command.
6. At every terminal, validate the result, return it, and purge all task-session intermediates. Preserve only approved product-source or external mutations.

## CONTEXT BY STATE

| State or phase | Allowed | Forbidden |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intent + plan` | release, manifest, provider and environment metadata | credentials, product source and unrelated provider inventory |
| `approval + apply` | frozen plan, exact approval and opaque credential handles | raw secrets, new discovery and undeclared resources |
| `monitor` | same release identity, declared probes, attempt counter and backoff metadata | new deployment context and unrelated telemetry |
| `recover or rollback` | observed failure, bounded action plan and mutation receipts | different release targets and business reconciliation |
| `proof + reconcile` | public steady/rolled-back proof and frozen business receipt when eligible | raw credentials and mutable intermediate plans |
