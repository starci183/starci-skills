# Changelog

## 1.2.2 — 2026-09-29

- Align module aliases and explicit public `index.ts` exports with HFS capability boundaries. Keep self-aliases, tier-only aliases, folder re-exports, and export-star public entries invalid.
- Accept concrete exceptions in their owning module or feature `errors/` directory, and accept the shared `AbstractException` declaration at its capability root.
- Classify a `.spec.ts` beside its subject in an HFS `src/tests` category as a colocated structural spec. Ordinary unit specs without an adjacent subject remain invalid in test buckets; model-quality harness checks remain in force.
