# Consensus replication state monitor

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `consensus-replication-state-monitor` |
| Family | Overview |
| Dominant task | Determine whether a replicated cluster can safely commit, which member lags, and what membership or leadership action preserves quorum. |
| Search aliases | `Raft quorum monitor`, `replication commit index`, `cluster membership safety` |
| Authority | Shared product-neutral macro topology; Grammar owns product semantics, Principles own unresolved geometry, and Direction owns visual character. |

### Invariants

- Determine whether a replicated cluster can safely commit, which member lags, and what membership or leadership action preserves quorum.
- Quorum, term, and commit index govern every member, leadership, and membership action.
- Every required region retains a separate owner and the same selected context; product nouns do not change the topology.
- Wide, intermediate, and compact preserve meaningful DOM, reading, and focus order, action parity, and deterministic recovery.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-CRS-01` | The dominant task is the required observable outcome. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-CRS-02` | The complete required region graph and named relationships are necessary. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-CRS-03` | Compact preserves wide actions, state, recovery, and focus meaning. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-CRS-04` | Task-specific state can change after the user creates work state. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-CRS-90` | The dominant task is actually generic operations command center. | Reject. |
| `AR-CRS-91` | The dominant task is actually dependency monitor. | Reject. |
| `AR-CRS-92` | The dominant task is actually portfolio matrix. | Reject. |
| `AR-CRS-93` | The dominant task is actually log console. | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `consensus-replication-state-monitor` if and only if `AR-CRS-01` through `AR-CRS-04` are evidenced and none of `AR-CRS-90` through `AR-CRS-93` holds. Return `needs-evidence` when an owner or relationship is unresolved; return `reject` when a rejection code holds.

## Region graph

```text
replication-monitor -> cluster-and-term-context -> quorum-health -> member-role-and-commit-index-matrix -> leader-log-progression -> replication-lag -> election-timeline -> selected-member-evidence -> safe-membership-or-leadership-action
```

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner and relationship obligation |
|---|---|
| `replication-monitor` | Owns the dominant task, all descendant state, and the recovery boundary. |
| `cluster-and-term-context` | Owns Cluster And Term Context evidence or action and preserves its declared relationship to the current selection. |
| `quorum-health` | Owns Quorum Health evidence or action and preserves its declared relationship to the current selection. |
| `member-role-and-commit-index-matrix` | Owns Member Role And Commit Index Matrix evidence or action and preserves its declared relationship to the current selection. |
| `leader-log-progression` | Owns Leader Log Progression evidence or action and preserves its declared relationship to the current selection. |
| `replication-lag` | Owns Replication Lag evidence or action and preserves its declared relationship to the current selection. |
| `election-timeline` | Owns Election Timeline evidence or action and preserves its declared relationship to the current selection. |
| `selected-member-evidence` | Owns Selected Member Evidence evidence or action and preserves its declared relationship to the current selection. |
| `safe-membership-or-leadership-action` | Owns Safe Membership Or Leadership Action evidence or action and preserves its declared relationship to the current selection. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous regions can no longer retain readable labels, exact associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Quorum summary, member matrix, log progression, and election evidence remain simultaneously visible.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while every required region remains simultaneously usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current-task status or action may persist; it reserves space and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `member-role-and-commit-index-matrix` is the only bounded owner on the necessary axis; the page owns no overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority supporting region makes the primary relationship unusable.
- **Topology response:** The member matrix is primary; selected-member evidence becomes temporary while the quorum invariant persists.
- **Navigation replacement:** A named disclosure or drawer replaces the displaced region and preserves exact selection and trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** The current verdict or action persists only while its target and status remain visible and returns to flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `member-role-and-commit-index-matrix` retains bounded overflow; the drawer creates no nested page scroll.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two task regions cannot simultaneously preserve readable evidence, 44-pixel targets, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Quorum verdict → lagging members → commit indices and log gap → election evidence → safe action.
- **Navigation replacement:** A primary-pane sequence with Back restores selection, state, query, scroll context, and the exact trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** The action bar reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `member-role-and-commit-index-matrix` has a textual or list equivalent as primary when its bounded view does not fit.

### Reflow

- Semantic, DOM, and meaningful focus order preserve the graph: `replication-monitor -> cluster-and-term-context -> quorum-health -> member-role-and-commit-index-matrix -> leader-log-progression -> replication-lag -> election-timeline -> selected-member-evidence -> safe-membership-or-leadership-action`.
- Long labels, translation, zoom, and enlarged controls trigger the same named topology changes.
- CSS never reorders semantics; ordinary content creates no page-level horizontal scroll.
- Hidden detail always has an explicit accessible reveal path.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, edit, action, explanation, retry, and recovery remains reachable at intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact selected object, cursor or order, data state, pending result, and error context.
- Pointer actions have keyboard and single-pointer non-drag equivalents when movement is involved.
- Dynamic updates announce one contextual status without stealing focus; color is never the only signal.
- A modal receives and contains focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.

## State obligations

Task-specific states: leader known, leader unknown, quorum healthy, quorum lost, quorum at risk, voter, learner, offline, term changed, lag normal, lag high, election in progress, unsafe action, pending action, success, stale data.

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `cluster-and-term-context` | Name the loading scope, reserve the primary region, and block only the failed owner. |
| Ready | `quorum-health` | Expose the current object, owner relationship, selection, and valid action in text and semantics. |
| Empty / not applicable | `quorum-health` | Distinguish true empty, no-match, and non-applicable states and provide the valid next action. |
| Error / retry | `selected-member-evidence` | Keep valid context and input, name the failed owner, and provide local retry. |
| Permission / unavailable | `safe-membership-or-leadership-action` | Do not imply hidden evidence is absent; explain the restriction and provide a safe exit. |
| Pending | `safe-membership-or-leadership-action` | Prevent duplicate action, retain the exact target, and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `safe-membership-or-leadership-action` | Confirm the exact outcome, preserve selection, and provide the next valid action or recovery. |
| Stale / conflict | `cluster-and-term-context` | Keep the last safe value, identify the version or time conflict, and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `safe-membership-or-leadership-action` | Move focus only to a modal or newly required error summary, then return it to the exact trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `replication-monitor` | Preserve state, selection, query, pending result, and recovery when topology changes. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when the dominant task is: Determine whether a replicated cluster can safely commit, which member lags, and what membership or leadership action preserves quorum.
- Accept when every required region and relationship in the graph is necessary to complete the task.
- Accept when compact preserves the task, state, and recovery through a replacement topology instead of stacking desktop boxes.

### Reject

- Reject generic operations command center; this is `AR-CRS-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject dependency monitor; this is `AR-CRS-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject portfolio matrix; this is `AR-CRS-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject log console; this is `AR-CRS-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete graph, and compact parity all hold. Differences limited to noun, density, color, component, card count, or state are `duplicate-or-variation`.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permitted actions, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

External research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It supports synthesis of task relationships, adaptive behavior, and accessibility obligations; it does not select StarCi owners, exact geometry, or permission to copy a source interface.

### Sources

| Source | What it supports | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| [etcd — Raft glossary](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/glossary/) | Leader, proposal, member, and majority quorum concepts. | Does not select this archetype, define product truth, or authorize copied geometry. |
| [Apache Kafka — Replication](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design_replicatedlog) | Leader and replica log progression semantics. | Does not select this archetype, define product truth, or authorize copied geometry. |
| [IBM Carbon — Data table](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/) | Explicit row-column relationships, selection, and bounded overflow. | Does not select this archetype, define product truth, or authorize copied geometry. |
| [W3C WAI — Status messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html) | Status changes announced without moving focus. | Does not select this archetype, define product truth, or authorize copied geometry. |

The source set includes at least three independent official organizations and W3C accessibility evidence.
