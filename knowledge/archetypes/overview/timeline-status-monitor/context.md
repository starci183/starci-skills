## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `timeline-status-monitor` |
| Family | Overview |
| Dominant task | Follow multiple status streams on one shared time axis to detect overlap, delay, and abnormal transition. |
| Search aliases | `state timeline`, `status swimlanes`, `live time monitor`, `transition monitor` |
| Authority | Shared, product-neutral macro topology. |

### Invariants

- Every lane uses the same time coordinate and pause or follow state.
- The region graph remains `status-monitor` → `time-range-and-live-controls` → `shared-time-axis` → `status-swimlanes` → `current-marker` → `anomaly-summary` → `selected-interval-detail`.
- DOM order, reading order, and meaningful focus order remain identical.
- Grammar owns product meaning; Principles own unresolved geometry; Direction owns visual character.
- Loading, ready, empty, error, unavailable, pending, success, and stale or conflict states preserve the dominant task.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-TS-01` | The dominant task is: Follow multiple status streams on one shared time axis to detect overlap, delay, and abnormal transition. | Candidate evidence. |
| `AR-TS-02` | The complete required region graph must remain semantically present. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-TS-03` | Compact must retain wide selection, action, state, and recovery. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-TS-04` | Each region has an independent owner and retains the current selection association. | Preserve as an invariant. |
| `AR-TS-90` | retrospective audit causality | Reject. |
| `AR-TS-91` | project plan editing | Reject. |
| `AR-TS-92` | calendar event browsing | Reject. |
| `AR-TS-93` | raw append-only logs | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `timeline-status-monitor` only when `AR-TS-01`, `AR-TS-02`, and `AR-TS-03` are evidenced and none of `AR-TS-90`, `AR-TS-91`, `AR-TS-92`, or `AR-TS-93` describes the dominant task. If one required relationship is unknown, return `needs-evidence`; if a rejection code holds, return `reject` instead of adapting this topology by visual resemblance.

## Region graph

```text
status-monitor
└─ time-range-and-live-controls
   └─ shared-time-axis
      └─ status-swimlanes
         └─ current-marker
            └─ anomaly-summary
               └─ selected-interval-detail
```

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `status-monitor` | Owns the page-level status monitor task and all descendant state. | Root of the graph. |
| `time-range-and-live-controls` | Owns time range and live controls evidence or action without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `status-monitor` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `shared-time-axis` | Owns shared time axis evidence or action without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `time-range-and-live-controls` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `status-swimlanes` | Owns status swimlanes evidence or action without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `shared-time-axis` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `current-marker` | Owns current marker evidence or action without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `status-swimlanes` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `anomaly-summary` | Owns anomaly summary evidence or action without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `current-marker` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `selected-interval-detail` | Owns selected interval detail evidence or action without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `anomaly-summary` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when the simultaneous regions cannot retain readable labels, exact associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Keep the shared axis and multiple swimlanes simultaneous while selected interval detail supports them.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while all required regions remain simultaneously usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only an active cross-region action may persist; it reserves space and yields when height cannot keep focused content visible.
- **Overflow owner:** `status-swimlanes` alone may own bounded horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority supporting region makes the primary relationship unusable.
- **Topology response:** Reduce the visible range or group lanes before moving detail into an overlay.
- **Navigation replacement:** Replace the displaced supporting region with a named button or disclosure that exposes current selection and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** A persistent action remains only while its exact target and status stay visible; it becomes in-flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `status-swimlanes` keeps the only bounded overflow axis and exposes keyboard instructions.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two simultaneous task regions no longer preserve readable evidence and 44-by-44 CSS-pixel controls.
- **Topology response:** Choose one lane and time window, then render its event and status sequence vertically.
- **Navigation replacement:** Use an explicit primary-pane sequence with Back that restores selection, filter, state, and scroll context.
- **Sticky boundary:** A bottom action reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `status-swimlanes` is optional; its text or list equivalent is primary.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `status-monitor` → `time-range-and-live-controls` → `shared-time-axis` → `status-swimlanes` → `current-marker` → `anomaly-summary` → `selected-interval-detail`.
- Text, zoom, long translation, and enlarged controls trigger the same named topology changes.
- No CSS ordering changes the visual sequence away from keyboard or assistive-technology order.
- Long labels wrap; hidden detail has an explicit accessible reveal path.
- Ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scrolling.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, action, explanation, retry, and recovery path remains reachable in intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact selected entity, filters, data state, and pending or completed result.
- Dynamic updates announce one contextual status message without stealing focus.
- Any modal traps focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.
- Color, position, and geometry always have a textual or structural equivalent.

## State obligations

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `time-range-and-live-controls` | Identify the scope and the region that is pending; preserve the semantic position. |
| Ready | `shared-time-axis` | Expose the complete dominant task with every lane uses the same time coordinate and pause or follow state. |
| Empty / not applicable | `status-swimlanes` | Distinguish meaningful absence from unavailable evidence and state why the region does not apply. |
| Error / retry | `current-marker` | Keep valid context, name the failed owner, and offer a local retry without resetting selection. |
| Permission / unavailable | `selected-interval-detail` | Do not imply hidden evidence is absent; provide a safe exit or alternate route. |
| Pending | `selected-interval-detail` | Prevent duplicate action, retain the exact target and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `selected-interval-detail` | Expose the outcome, preserve the selected context, and provide the next valid action. |
| Stale / conflict | `time-range-and-live-controls` | Keep the last safe value, identify version or time conflict, and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `selected-interval-detail` | Move focus only for an opened modal or newly required error summary, then return it to the exact trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `status-monitor` | Preserve state, selection, query, and recovery when topology changes. |

Applicable state family: live, follow, paused, range loading, no events, delayed update, out-of-order update, unknown interval, selected anomaly, timezone, reconnect, stale marker.

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when several state streams require one shared time axis.
- Accept when overlap or delay is decision evidence.
- Accept when pause and follow preserve the selected interval.

### Reject

- Reject retrospective audit causality; this is `AR-TS-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject project plan editing; this is `AR-TS-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject calendar event browsing; this is `AR-TS-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject raw append-only logs; this is `AR-TS-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete region graph, and compact interaction parity all hold. Return `reject` for any rejection code. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unresolved. Differences limited to nouns, card count, density, color, component, or state are `duplicate-or-variation`, not a new archetype.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permitted actions, eligibility, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow realization, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

External research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It supports the synthesis of task relationships, adaptive behavior, and accessibility obligations; it does not name StarCi owners, select exact geometry, or grant permission to copy a source interface.
