# Support handoff redaction review

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | support-handoff-redaction-review |
| Family | support |
| Dominant task | Review captured support items, decide retain, redact, or omit per item, and preview exactly what a recipient receives. |
| Search aliases | support-handoff-redaction-review; support handoff redaction review |
| Authority | Dominant-task topology, region graph, responsive transformation, interaction parity, and state families. |

### Invariants

- Review captured support items, decide retain, redact, or omit per item, and preview exactly what a recipient receives.
- Each region has one semantic owner; supporting context never takes over the dominant task.
- DOM order, reading order, and focus order preserve meaning across wide, intermediate, and compact.
- Grammar supplies product facts; Principles resolve exact geometry; the archetype does not own visual direction.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| AR-SHR-01 | Review captured support items, decide retain, redact, or omit per item, and preview exactly what a recipient receives. | required positive evidence |
| AR-SHR-02 | Every required region and critical relationship has an independent owner. | required positive evidence |
| AR-SHR-03 | The wide relationship stops working, but compact must preserve task, state, and recovery. | transformation trigger |
| AR-SHR-90 | the task is request composition, document diff, file management, a share dialog, or live conversation. | reject |
| AR-SHR-91 | The difference is only a product noun, density, color, component, or card count. | duplicate-or-variation |

### Selection rule

Return accept only when AR-SHR-01 and AR-SHR-02 are evidenced, neither AR-SHR-90 nor AR-SHR-91 is present, and the region graph remains necessary across all three topologies. Return needs-evidence when an owner or transformation is unresolved.

Critical relationship: Source item, redaction decision, privacy risk, and recipient output remain separate owners.

### Region obligations

| Region ID | Owner | Required relationship |
|---|---|---|
| redaction-review | Owns the bounded page task and contains every required region; it does not invent product semantics. | Contains handoff-purpose-and-recipient, captured-item-queue, selected-item-redaction-editor, privacy-risk-summary, recipient-preview, consent-and-handoff while preserving their independent owners. |
| handoff-purpose-and-recipient | Owns stable subject, scope, and orientation facts for every downstream decision. | Orients captured-item-queue without replacing its owner. |
| captured-item-queue | Owns membership, item identity, status, and the current selection for this bounded collection. | Receives context from handoff-purpose-and-recipient and constrains selected-item-redaction-editor without merging their authorities. |
| selected-item-redaction-editor | Owns the currently selected input or choice and preserves its pending and recovery state. | Receives context from captured-item-queue and constrains privacy-risk-summary without merging their authorities. |
| privacy-risk-summary | Owns the named invariant or derived state and exposes it in text rather than color alone. | Receives context from selected-item-redaction-editor and constrains recipient-preview without merging their authorities. |
| recipient-preview | Owns the derived interpretation or consequence preview; it never becomes a second input source. | Receives context from privacy-risk-summary and constrains consent-and-handoff without merging their authorities. |
| consent-and-handoff | Owns the named invariant or derived state and exposes it in text rather than color alone. | Consumes verified state from recipient-preview and emits the bounded outcome or recovery path. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- Inspect queue, editor, and recipient preview together while unresolved privacy risk stays associated with the item.
- Failure trigger: simultaneous regions narrow content, obscure state, or break owner relationships.
- Navigation replacement is unnecessary while regions remain simultaneous; sticky is allowed only for context that fits.
- The page owns vertical overflow; only an intrinsically two-dimensional region may own bounded overflow.

### Intermediate

- Move recipient preview into the temporary pane while queue and editor remain primary.
- Failure trigger: supporting persistence competes with primary-task measure or focus.
- A named trigger opens the temporary pane; Escape closes it and focus returns to the trigger.
- Sticky behavior yields at short height; the page remains the overflow owner.

### Compact

- Stage queue, editor, preview, consent, and handoff; Back restores the exact item and redaction draft.
- Failure trigger: multiple panes are no longer simultaneously operable with 16px text and 44px targets.
- Previous, Next, and a stage selector replace pane adjacency; Back preserves selection and draft.
- No page-level horizontal scrolling is allowed; sticky or fixed surfaces never obscure content or focus.

### Reflow

The region graph order is the DOM and reading order at every width. CSS does not reorder it. Text, localization, zoom, and spacing growth increase region height or trigger a topology change; content is not clipped. Region state survives movement into and out of the temporary pane.

### Interaction parity

Wide, intermediate, and compact expose the same action, selection, pending guard, success, error, retry, stale/conflict recovery, and outcome. Dynamic status is announced through a polite live region without stealing focus. A dialog contains focus, supports Escape or cancel, and returns focus to its exact trigger.

## State obligations

Domain state catalog: item loading/unsupported; retain/redact/omit; detected sensitive data; unresolved risk; stale preview; changed recipient; missing consent; handoff pending/failure/success; audit record.

| State family | Obligation | Focus transition | Responsive presentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| initial/loading | Preserve known anatomy and name the waiting region. | Do not move focus automatically. | Keep the same stage identity. |
| ready | Show internally consistent, product-neutral demo data. | Focus remains at the activating control. | Preserve selection. |
| empty/not-applicable | Explain why content is empty and any valid next step. | Move to recovery only when continuation needs it. | Do not erase other required regions. |
| error/retry | Associate the error with its owner and provide bounded retry. | Multi-error moves to the summary; retry returns to the owner. | Error is not color-only. |
| permission/unavailable | Preserve orientation and explain the limitation. | Do not focus a locked control. | Use the same reason in every topology. |
| pending | Prevent duplicates and preserve the action meaning. | Do not steal focus for progress. | State stays with its action owner. |
| success | Confirm the outcome and a valid continuation. | Move focus only when it helps continuation. | Do not create a second source of truth. |
| stale/conflict | Name the changed version and preserve safe input. | Focus a contextual recovery choice. | Selection survives transformation. |
| domain states | Account token redacted locally; source capture remains unchanged. Unsupported attachment omitted with an audit reason. Recipient preview refreshed and unresolved risk count is zero. Consent recorded; handoff completed with a traceable receipt. | Every modal returns focus to its trigger. | Preserve action and recovery parity. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

Accept when the dominant task needs this exact region graph, its critical relationship creates a distinct topology, and all responsive states preserve task and recovery parity.

### Reject

Reject when the task is request composition, document diff, file management, a share dialog, or live conversation, or when the candidate only changes nouns, cards, or density from another archetype.

### Boundary verdict

The valid result is accept, reject, duplicate-or-variation, or needs-evidence under the Situation-code rule; visual preference is not evidence.

## Handoff

- Grammar receives real facts, semantic owners, permissions, states, and action consequences.
- Principles receives exact grid, measure, gaps, sizing, alignment, overflow, thresholds, sticky offsets, and focus accommodation.
- Direction receives visual character; the template is only one conforming realization.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

The official sources below are advisory evidence. They are not product truth, do not imply that a source organization names this synthesized archetype, and do not authorize copying geometry, component trees, nouns, or breakpoints.
