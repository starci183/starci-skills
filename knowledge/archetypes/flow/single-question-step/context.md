# Single question step

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `single-question-step` |
| Family | `flow` |
| Dominant task | Answer exactly one question in a transaction and continue while retaining a trustworthy return path. |
| Search aliases | `one question per page`, `transaction question step`, `single answer step` |
| Authority | Product-neutral macro topology and behavior contract. |

### Invariants

- The archetype owns only the dominant task, required regions, region relationships, responsive transformations, interaction parity, and state families.
- Grammar owns product nouns, semantic owners, domain rules, and state transitions.
- Principles own exact geometry, measure, gap, alignment, overflow values, and responsive thresholds.
- Direction owns visual character; the template is only one neutral conforming realization.
- Reading order, DOM order, and focus order retain one semantic sequence across every topology.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `SQS-01` | Answer exactly one question in a transaction and continue while retaining a trustworthy return path. | required positive |
| `SQS-02` | All required regions and their named ownership relationships are necessary for the task. | required positive |
| `SQS-03` | Wide adjacency fails while intermediate and compact transformations preserve task, state, and recovery. | conditional positive |
| `SQS-90` | Reject a standalone centered single task or multiple independent questions. | reject |
| `SQS-91` | Reject an application overview, assessment navigator, or settings editor. | reject |

### Selection rule

- Return `accept` only when `SQS-01` and `SQS-02` are evidenced and no 90–99 code is present.
- Return `reject` when `SQS-90` or `SQS-91` is evidenced, or an adjacent archetype owns the dominant task.
- Return `needs-evidence` when the task, required region, relationship, or responsive failure trigger remains unresolved.

## Region graph

```text
question-step
├─ return-navigation
├─ section-and-progress-context
├─ question-label-and-instructions
├─ answer-control
├─ progression-actions
└─ contextual-help
```

- **Shared relationship:** The label or legend semantically owns the answer; progress only orients the transaction; Back and Continue preserve the same answer revision and browser-history path.
- `question-step -> return-navigation`: `return-navigation` consumes the named context or revision from `question-step` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `return-navigation -> section-and-progress-context`: `section-and-progress-context` consumes the named context or revision from `return-navigation` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `section-and-progress-context -> question-label-and-instructions`: `question-label-and-instructions` consumes the named context or revision from `section-and-progress-context` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `question-label-and-instructions -> answer-control`: `answer-control` consumes the named context or revision from `question-label-and-instructions` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `answer-control -> progression-actions`: `progression-actions` consumes the named context or revision from `answer-control` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `progression-actions -> contextual-help`: `contextual-help` consumes the named context or revision from `progression-actions` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.

### Region obligations

| Region | Obligation |
|---|---|
| `question-step` | Owns the complete question step transaction boundary, shared revision, and recovery context; child regions cannot commit outside it. |
| `return-navigation` | Owns the return navigation input or decision and updates the shared transaction revision while preserving its label, status, and contextual actions. |
| `section-and-progress-context` | Owns the derived section and progress context state; it names its source revision and cannot contradict the input or evidence owners. |
| `question-label-and-instructions` | Owns the question label and instructions input or decision and updates the shared transaction revision while preserving its label, status, and contextual actions. |
| `answer-control` | Owns the answer control input or decision and updates the shared transaction revision while preserving its label, status, and contextual actions. |
| `progression-actions` | Owns the derived progression actions state; it names its source revision and cannot contradict the input or evidence owners. |
| `contextual-help` | Owns the contextual help recovery route and preserves the exact state, trigger, and return position. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** A required region can no longer remain simultaneous without squeezing, truncating, or separating context from action.
- **Topology response:** A readable form column owns the question while progress and adjacent help remain subordinate.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** The lowest-priority supporting region can no longer persist while retaining readable measure and action order.
- **Topology response:** Supporting help follows the answer control or becomes an adjacent disclosure without creating a second form pane.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Adjacency or multiple primary panes no longer work under zoom, localization, text growth, or short height.
- **Topology response:** Question, hint, answer, and Continue form one uninterrupted sequence; Back preserves the selected answer.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `question-step` → `return-navigation` → `section-and-progress-context` → `question-label-and-instructions` → `answer-control` → `progression-actions` → `contextual-help`.
- CSS does not reorder regions or the focus sequence at a topology transition.
- Compact navigation replaces adjacency with a named primary pane and restores the exact trigger, state, and scroll context.

### Interaction parity

- Wide, intermediate, and compact retain the same actions, state meanings, recovery paths, and consequence.
- Dynamic status is announced without moving focus automatically.
- Error recovery moves focus to a summary or repairable field and then returns to the meaningful continuation.

## State obligations

| State | Required behavior | Responsive presentation |
|---|---|---|
| `unanswered` | Distinguish a valid absence from missing required input and expose the next available start path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `prefilled` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `conditional reveal` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `validation pending` | Announce progress without moving focus, preserve the current revision, and prevent only the duplicate operation. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `validation error` | Name the cause at its owner, expose a focusable repair path, and preserve safe input for retry. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `saved draft` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `stale carried-forward answer` | Identify the conflicting revision, block stale commitment, and reconcile without discarding unaffected state. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `permission unavailable` | Explain the unavailable boundary, retain readable context, and expose an eligible alternate or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `continue pending` | Announce progress without moving focus, preserve the current revision, and prevent only the duplicate operation. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `continued` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Use when one semantic question owns the current transaction step.
- Required regions must share one transaction state model and one provable recovery path.

### Reject

- Reject a standalone centered single task or multiple independent questions.
- Reject an application overview, assessment navigator, or settings editor.
- Reject when the difference is only a product noun, card count, density, color, component, or state variation.

### Boundary verdict

- Default `needs-evidence`; `accept` is valid only under the executable selection rule above.

## Handoff

- **Grammar:** Supplies product actors, nouns, semantic owners, domain rules, eligibility, transitions, and consequences.
- **Principles:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, size, alignment, overflow, sticky offsets, and content-driven thresholds.
- **Direction:** Resolve visual character without changing topology or ownership.

|---|---|---|
| [GOV.UK Design System — Question pages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/) | A question keeps its label, answer, Back path, and Continue action coherent. | It does not authorize copying GOV.UK visual treatment. |
| [U.S. Web Design System — Complete a complex form](https://designsystem.digital.gov/patterns/complete-a-complex-form/) | Long transactions preserve progress, review, and recovery. | It does not define a product workflow or fixed step count. |
| [W3C WAI — Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages) | Dynamic results can be announced without moving focus. | It does not define transaction states or timing. |
| [W3C WAI — Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order.html) | Logical focus follows relationships and preserves operability. | It does not select this archetype or define product facts. |
