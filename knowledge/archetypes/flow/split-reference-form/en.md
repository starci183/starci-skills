# Split reference form

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `split-reference-form` |
| Family | `flow` |
| Dominant task | Enter data while continuously cross-referencing a structured source with stable anchors. |
| Search aliases | `reference-assisted form`, `side-by-side source entry`, `anchored reference form` |
| Authority | Product-neutral macro topology and behavior contract. |

### Invariants

- The archetype owns only the dominant task, required regions, region relationships, responsive transformations, interaction parity, and state families.
- Grammar owns product nouns, semantic owners, domain rules, and state transitions.
- Principles own exact geometry, measure, gap, alignment, overflow values, and responsive thresholds.
- Direction owns visual character; the template is only one neutral conforming realization.
- Reading order, DOM order, and focus order retain one semantic sequence across every topology.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `SRF-01` | Enter data while continuously cross-referencing a structured source with stable anchors. | required positive |
| `SRF-02` | All required regions and their named ownership relationships are necessary for the task. | required positive |
| `SRF-03` | Wide adjacency fails while intermediate and compact transformations preserve task, state, and recovery. | conditional positive |
| `SRF-90` | Reject short hints, single-question steps, or list-detail explorers. | reject |
| `SRF-91` | Reject document readers, generic two-column forms, or centered tasks. | reject |

### Selection rule

- Return `accept` only when `SRF-01` and `SRF-02` are evidenced and no 90–99 code is present.
- Return `reject` when `SRF-90` or `SRF-91` is evidenced, or an adjacent archetype owns the dominant task.
- Return `needs-evidence` when the task, required region, relationship, or responsive failure trigger remains unresolved.

## Region graph

```text
reference-form
├─ task-and-reference-context
├─ reference-source
├─ form-sections
├─ cross-reference-validation
└─ save-and-continue-actions
```

- **Shared relationship:** Reference and form share stable anchors while the form owns submission; validation compares the current reference version with the corresponding draft fields.
- `reference-form -> task-and-reference-context`: `task-and-reference-context` consumes the named context or revision from `reference-form` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `task-and-reference-context -> reference-source`: `reference-source` consumes the named context or revision from `task-and-reference-context` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `reference-source -> form-sections`: `form-sections` consumes the named context or revision from `reference-source` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `form-sections -> cross-reference-validation`: `cross-reference-validation` consumes the named context or revision from `form-sections` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `cross-reference-validation -> save-and-continue-actions`: `save-and-continue-actions` consumes the named context or revision from `cross-reference-validation` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.

### Region obligations

| Region | Obligation |
|---|---|
| `reference-form` | Owns the complete reference form transaction boundary, shared revision, and recovery context; child regions cannot commit outside it. |
| `task-and-reference-context` | Owns the task and reference context orientation and immutable basis that qualifies every downstream decision. |
| `reference-source` | Owns the reference source input or decision and updates the shared transaction revision while preserving its label, status, and contextual actions. |
| `form-sections` | Owns the form sections input or decision and updates the shared transaction revision while preserving its label, status, and contextual actions. |
| `cross-reference-validation` | Owns the derived cross reference validation state; it names its source revision and cannot contradict the input or evidence owners. |
| `save-and-continue-actions` | Owns the save and continue actions input or decision and updates the shared transaction revision while preserving its label, status, and contextual actions. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** A required region can no longer remain simultaneous without squeezing, truncating, or separating context from action.
- **Topology response:** Reference and form remain simultaneous; only the reference may own bounded independent scrolling for anchor sync.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** The lowest-priority supporting region can no longer persist while retaining readable measure and action order.
- **Topology response:** Reference becomes a collapsible rail with the current anchor summary while the form keeps readable width.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Adjacency or multiple primary panes no longer work under zoom, localization, text growth, or short height.
- **Topology response:** Reference and form become two-stage views; closing reference returns to the exact field, anchor, and draft value.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `reference-form` → `task-and-reference-context` → `reference-source` → `form-sections` → `cross-reference-validation` → `save-and-continue-actions`.
- CSS does not reorder regions or the focus sequence at a topology transition.
- Compact navigation replaces adjacency with a named primary pane and restores the exact trigger, state, and scroll context.

### Interaction parity

- Wide, intermediate, and compact retain the same actions, state meanings, recovery paths, and consequence.
- Dynamic status is announced without moving focus automatically.
- Error recovery moves focus to a summary or repairable field and then returns to the meaningful continuation.

## State obligations

| State | Required behavior | Responsive presentation |
|---|---|---|
| `reference loading` | Announce progress without moving focus, preserve the current revision, and prevent only the duplicate operation. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `reference missing` | Explain the unavailable boundary, retain readable context, and expose an eligible alternate or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `reference stale` | Identify the conflicting revision, block stale commitment, and reconcile without discarding unaffected state. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `version changed` | Identify the conflicting revision, block stale commitment, and reconcile without discarding unaffected state. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `anchor selected` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `anchor unresolved` | Name the cause at its owner, expose a focusable repair path, and preserve safe input for retry. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `form draft` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `validation error` | Name the cause at its owner, expose a focusable repair path, and preserve safe input for retry. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `cross-field mismatch` | Name the cause at its owner, expose a focusable repair path, and preserve safe input for retry. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `autosave pending` | Announce progress without moving focus, preserve the current revision, and prevent only the duplicate operation. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `autosave error` | Name the cause at its owner, expose a focusable repair path, and preserve safe input for retry. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `conflict` | Identify the conflicting revision, block stale commitment, and reconcile without discarding unaffected state. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `permission unavailable` | Explain the unavailable boundary, retain readable context, and expose an eligible alternate or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `focus reference to field` | Move focus only after an explicit action or failed submit, then restore the exact trigger and semantic context. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Use when a structured reference must remain repeatedly available during data entry.
- Required regions must share one transaction state model and one provable recovery path.

### Reject

- Reject short hints, single-question steps, or list-detail explorers.
- Reject document readers, generic two-column forms, or centered tasks.
- Reject when the difference is only a product noun, card count, density, color, component, or state variation.

### Boundary verdict

- Default `needs-evidence`; `accept` is valid only under the executable selection rule above.

## Handoff

- **Grammar:** Supplies product actors, nouns, semantic owners, domain rules, eligibility, transitions, and consequences.
- **Principles:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, size, alignment, overflow, sticky offsets, and content-driven thresholds.
- **Direction:** Resolve visual character without changing topology or ownership.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

The sources below are advisory comparison evidence. They are not product truth, do not select a Grammar owner, do not authorize copied geometry or component trees, and do not override Source authority.

### Sources

| Source | What it supports | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| [Apple HIG — Split views](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/split-views) | Adjacent panes collapse when each pane can no longer remain operable. | It does not define web controls or product semantics. |
| [GOV.UK Design System — Question pages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/) | A question keeps its label, answer, Back path, and Continue action coherent. | It does not authorize copying GOV.UK visual treatment. |
| [W3C WAI — Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order.html) | Logical focus follows relationships and preserves operability. | It does not select this archetype or define product facts. |
| [W3C WAI — Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow) | Required content reflows without page-level two-dimensional scrolling. | It does not prescribe a breakpoint or region geometry. |
