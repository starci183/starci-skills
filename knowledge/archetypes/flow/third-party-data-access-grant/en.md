# Third-party data access grant

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | third-party-data-access-grant |
| Family | flow |
| Dominant task | Decide a runtime data-access grant for a named third party by resource, purpose, scope, and duration, allowing partial denial and a clear revocation path. |
| Search aliases | third-party-data-access-grant; third-party authorization; granular access grant; partial scope denial |
| Authority | Dominant-task topology, region graph, responsive transformation, interaction parity, and state families. |

### Invariants

- Decide a runtime data-access grant for a named third party by resource, purpose, scope, and duration, allowing partial denial and a clear revocation path.
- Each required region has one semantic owner; supporting context never takes over the dominant task.
- DOM order, reading order, and focus order preserve meaning across wide, intermediate, and compact.
- Grammar supplies product facts; Principles resolve exact geometry; the archetype does not own visual direction.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| AR-TPG-01 | Decide a runtime data-access grant for a named third party by resource, purpose, scope, and duration, allowing partial denial and a clear revocation path. | required positive evidence |
| AR-TPG-02 | The critical region relationship and owner separation are evidenced. | required relationship evidence |
| AR-TPG-03 | The wide relationship fails, but compact preserves task, state, and recovery. | responsive transformation trigger |
| AR-TPG-04 | Error, permission, pending, success, and stale or conflict states have bounded recovery. | required state evidence |
| AR-TPG-90 | Reject signature ceremonies, permission matrices, delegated lifecycle management, and consent preferences. | reject |
| AR-TPG-91 | The difference is only a product noun, density, color, component, state skin, or card count. | duplicate-or-variation |

### Selection rule

Return accept only when AR-TPG-01, AR-TPG-02, and AR-TPG-03 are evidenced, neither AR-TPG-90 nor AR-TPG-91 is present, and every required region remains necessary across all three topologies. Return needs-evidence when an owner, relation, or transformation is unresolved.

Critical relationship: Each requested scope has an independent allow or deny decision; the receipt binds requester, purpose, resource, scope, duration, and revocation.

### Region obligations

| Region ID | Owner | Required relationship |
|---|---|---|
| access-grant | Owns the dominant-task boundary and contains every required region without inventing product semantics. | Contains requester-identity-trust, requested-resource-purpose-scope, existing-grants-conflicts, granular-decision, duration-consequence, allow-deny-receipt, revocation-path while preserving each region's independent owner. |
| requester-identity-trust | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Receives context from access-grant and gates requested-resource-purpose-scope without merging authority. |
| requested-resource-purpose-scope | Owns source evidence, provenance, freshness, and availability; it never decides the outcome. | Receives context from requester-identity-trust and gates existing-grants-conflicts without merging authority. |
| existing-grants-conflicts | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Receives context from requested-resource-purpose-scope and gates granular-decision without merging authority. |
| granular-decision | Owns editable decision state, validation, and the pending guard for the named stage. | Receives context from existing-grants-conflicts and gates duration-consequence without merging authority. |
| duration-consequence | Owns a derived interpretation or consequence preview; it never becomes a second input authority. | Receives context from granular-decision and gates allow-deny-receipt without merging authority. |
| allow-deny-receipt | Owns the bounded outcome, receipt, or recovery route after every upstream gate passes. | Receives context from duration-consequence and gates revocation-path without merging authority. |
| revocation-path | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Consumes verified state from allow-deny-receipt and emits the bounded outcome or recovery path. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- Topology response: Keep requester trust, requested resources and scopes, existing conflicts, and duration consequences simultaneously visible.
- Failure trigger: simultaneous regions narrow readable measure, obscure state, or break the named relationship.
- Navigation replacement: none while regions remain simultaneous; sticky is limited to orientation context that fits.
- Sticky boundary: yield at short height and never obscure a focused control.
- Overflow owner: the page owns vertical overflow; only an intrinsic matrix owns bounded horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- Topology response: Make granular scope decisions primary while requester and purpose summary persists.
- Failure trigger: supporting persistence competes with primary-task measure or focus.
- Navigation replacement: a named trigger opens the supporting dialog; Escape or Cancel closes it and focus returns to the exact trigger.
- Sticky boundary: persistent context yields at short height; the dialog body owns bounded vertical overflow.
- Overflow owner: the page retains vertical overflow; the supporting dialog owns only its internal overflow.

### Compact

- Topology response: Stage requester, purpose and resources, per-scope decisions, duration and consequence, then receipt and revocation.
- Failure trigger: the multi-pane relationship is no longer operable with 16px body text and 44px targets.
- Navigation replacement: Previous, Next, and a stage selector replace pane adjacency; Back preserves selection, draft, and recovery state.
- Sticky boundary: no fixed action bar; focused content remains visible.
- Overflow owner: no page-level horizontal scrolling; an intrinsic matrix becomes grouped records.

### Reflow

The region graph order is the DOM and reading order at every width. CSS does not reorder semantics. Text, localization, zoom, and spacing growth increase region height or trigger a topology change; content is not clipped. State survives movement into and out of the supporting pane.

### Interaction parity

Wide, intermediate, and compact expose the same action, selection, pending guard, success, error, retry, stale or conflict recovery, and outcome. Dynamic status is announced through a polite live region without stealing focus. A modal contains focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to its exact trigger.

## State obligations

Domain state catalog: requester verified/unknown; scope requested/allowed/denied; purpose insufficient; existing-grant conflict; duration invalid; grant pending/active/expired/revoked; receipt.

| State family | Obligation | Focus transition | Responsive presentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| initial/loading | Preserve known anatomy and name the waiting region. | Do not move focus automatically. | Keep the same stage identity. |
| ready | Show consistent fictional data and the current selection. | Focus remains at the activating control. | Preserve selection through transformation. |
| empty/not-applicable | Explain why content is empty and the valid next step. | Move to recovery only when continuation requires it. | Do not erase other required regions. |
| error/retry | Associate the error with its owner and provide bounded retry. | Multi-error focuses the summary; retry returns to the exact action. | Error is not color-only. |
| permission/unavailable | Preserve orientation and explain the limitation. | Do not focus a locked control. | Use the same reason in every topology. |
| pending | Prevent duplicates and preserve action meaning. | Do not steal focus for progress. | State stays with its action owner. |
| success | Confirm the outcome and a valid continuation. | Move focus only when it helps continuation. | Do not create a second source of truth. |
| stale/conflict | Name the changed version and preserve safe input. | Focus a contextual recovery choice. | Selection survives transformation. |
| domain states | Preserve the complete domain catalog: requester verified/unknown; scope requested/allowed/denied; purpose insufficient; existing-grant conflict; duration invalid; grant pending/active/expired/revoked; receipt. | Every modal returns focus to its trigger. | Preserve action and recovery parity. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

Accept when the dominant task needs this exact region graph, the critical relationship creates a distinct topology, and every responsive state preserves task and recovery parity.

### Reject

Reject signature ceremonies, permission matrices, delegated lifecycle management, and consent preferences. Also reject duplicate-or-variation when the candidate only changes nouns, density, components, or visual state.

### Boundary verdict

The valid result is accept, reject, duplicate-or-variation, or needs-evidence under the Situation-code rule; visual preference is not evidence.

## Handoff

- Grammar receives real facts, semantic owners, permissions, states, and action consequences.
- Principles receives exact grid, measure, gaps, sizing, alignment, overflow, thresholds, sticky offsets, and focus accommodation.
- Direction receives visual character; the template is only one conforming realization.
