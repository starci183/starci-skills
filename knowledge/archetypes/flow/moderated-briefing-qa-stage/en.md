# Moderated briefing qa stage

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `moderated-briefing-qa-stage` |
| Family | Flow |
| Dominant task | Moderate audience questions around a live briefing by triaging submissions, merging duplicates, routing approved questions to speakers, and publishing answered outcomes |
| Search aliases | moderated Q&A, speaker routing, question archive |
| Authority | Product-neutral page-topology authority; the archetype does not choose product semantics, visual direction, tokens, components, exact geometry, or breakpoints. |

### Invariants

- `briefing-qa` owns the complete dominant task and recovery boundary.
- Moderate audience questions around a live briefing by triaging submissions, merging duplicates, routing approved questions to speakers, and publishing answered outcomes
- Every required region retains its named owner and relationship; Grammar only binds product-semantic owners.
- Wide, intermediate, and compact change topology when a named relationship fails, never by device label.
- Transformation preserves selection, draft, pending work, error, recovery, reading order, and focus meaning.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Observable situation | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-MBQ-01` | Moderate audience questions around a live briefing by triaging submissions, merging duplicates, routing approved questions to speakers, and publishing answered outcomes | Required positive evidence. |
| `AR-MBQ-02` | Every required region and relationship in the graph is necessary to complete the task. | Require the complete graph. |
| `AR-MBQ-03` | Work state must survive all three named topology responses. | Require responsive parity. |
| `AR-MBQ-04` | Pending, error, permission, stale, or conflict can occur after work state exists. | Require recovery without lost input or focus meaning. |
| `AR-MBQ-90` | The dominant task belongs to an adjacent archetype named in the hard rejection. | Reject. |
| `AR-MBQ-91` | Reject cho chat, facilitated meeting, media annotation or support inbox; question moderation, duplicate clustering, speaker routing and published answer lifecycle are mandatory | Reject. |
| `AR-MBQ-92` | The candidate differs only by product noun, density, color, component, card count, or state variation. | Reject as `duplicate-or-variation`. |

### Selection rule

Select `moderated-briefing-qa-stage` if and only if `AR-MBQ-01`–`04` are evidenced, every required region and relationship is present, and none of `AR-MBQ-90`–`92` is present. Return `needs-evidence` when the dominant task, owner, overflow owner, or completion consequence is unproved; return `reject` when a rejection code is present.

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner and relationship obligation |
|---|---|
| `briefing-qa` | Owns the dominant task, complete state, and recovery boundary for moderated-briefing-qa-stage. |
| `briefing-stage-and-topic` | Owns briefing stage and topic; preserves the required relationship with upstream `briefing-qa` and downstream `incoming-question-queue`, and does not absorb another region's owner. |
| `incoming-question-queue` | Owns incoming question queue; preserves the required relationship with upstream `briefing-stage-and-topic` and downstream `moderation-and-duplicate-clusters`, and does not absorb another region's owner. |
| `moderation-and-duplicate-clusters` | Owns moderation and duplicate clusters; preserves the required relationship with upstream `incoming-question-queue` and downstream `approved-run-of-show`, and does not absorb another region's owner. |
| `approved-run-of-show` | Owns approved run of show; preserves the required relationship with upstream `moderation-and-duplicate-clusters` and downstream `speaker-routing-and-live-answer`, and does not absorb another region's owner. |
| `speaker-routing-and-live-answer` | Owns speaker routing and live answer; preserves the required relationship with upstream `approved-run-of-show` and downstream `answered-published-archive`, and does not absorb another region's owner. |
| `answered-published-archive` | Owns answered published archive; preserves the required relationship with upstream `speaker-routing-and-live-answer`, and does not absorb another region's owner. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** A named relationship no longer has enough measure for reading, operation, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Briefing stage, incoming queue, moderation detail and approved/run-of-show regions coexist
- **Navigation replacement:** None; direct region access still fits.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current scope or the primary action may persist after reserving space; short height returns it to normal flow.
- **Overflow owner:** Only an intrinsically tabular, board, graph, proof, or matrix region owns bounded overflow; the page owns no horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** A named relationship no longer has enough measure for reading, operation, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Stage and approved questions remain primary; incoming queue and moderation detail become drawers
- **Navigation replacement:** A labeled stage or drawer opens the exact supporting region and preserves query, selection, draft, scroll, and return-focus target.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current scope or the primary action may persist after reserving space; short height returns it to normal flow.
- **Overflow owner:** Only an intrinsically tabular, board, graph, proof, or matrix region owns bounded overflow; the page owns no horizontal overflow.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** A named relationship no longer has enough measure for reading, operation, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Question queue → selected moderation decision → approved speaker route → live answer status → published outcome; stage context remains a compact persistent header
- **Navigation replacement:** A labeled stage or drawer opens the exact supporting region and preserves query, selection, draft, scroll, and return-focus target.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current scope or the primary action may persist after reserving space; short height returns it to normal flow.
- **Overflow owner:** Only an intrinsically tabular, board, graph, proof, or matrix region owns bounded overflow; the page owns no horizontal overflow.

### Reflow

- DOM order, reading order và meaningful focus order are `briefing-qa → briefing-stage-and-topic → incoming-question-queue → moderation-and-duplicate-clusters → approved-run-of-show → speaker-routing-and-live-answer → answered-published-archive`; CSS never reorders semantics.
- Long labels, translation, 400% zoom, and enlarged text wrap without losing actions or state meaning.
- A dialog, drawer, or sheet focuses its heading, contains focus while modal, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns to the exact trigger with work context intact.

### Interaction parity

- Pointer, keyboard, and assistive technology reach every core action; drag or gesture always has a button or keyboard equivalent.
- A topology change never resets work state, duplicates a pending action, or changes an owner.
- Dynamic status uses text and semantics in addition to color, then announces without stealing focus.
- Validation retains input, exposes inline errors, focuses a summary for multiple errors, and supplies specific recovery.
- Task parity includes briefing scheduled/live/ended, question pending/approved/rejected/merged, sensitive content flagged, speaker unavailable, queued/asked/answered, answer unpublished, moderation conflict and archive success.

## State obligations

Task-specific states: briefing scheduled/live/ended, question pending/approved/rejected/merged, sensitive content flagged, speaker unavailable, queued/asked/answered, answer unpublished, moderation conflict and archive success.

| State family | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Initial / loading | Name the loading scope, reserve the primary region, and block only the failed region. |
| Ready | Expose the current object, owner relationship, and valid actions through text and semantics. |
| Empty / not-applicable | Distinguish true empty, no-match, and non-applicable states with an appropriate next action. |
| Error / retry | Name the failed scope, retain input and work state, and provide a focused retry or correction target. |
| Permission / unavailable | Explain the restriction in text; read-only differs from disabled and retains context. |
| Pending | Prevent duplicates, retain context, allow Cancel when safe, and announce progress. |
| Success | Confirm the exact changed scope, update related summaries, and preserve Undo or the next step when required. |
| Stale / conflict | Compare local and external state, never overwrite silently, and retain deterministic recovery. |
| Focus transition | A user-triggered stage change focuses the new heading; status-only updates do not move focus; modals return to the trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | Wide retains simultaneity; intermediate makes the lowest support temporary; compact uses one primary stage with parity. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Template must approve, merge and reject questions, route one to a speaker, announce live-answer transitions and publish the final answer without exposing rejected content
- Accept a variation only when the dominant task, required regions, relationships, transformations, and completion event remain unchanged.

### Reject

- Reject cho chat, facilitated meeting, media annotation or support inbox; question moderation, duplicate clustering, speaker routing and published answer lifecycle are mandatory
- Reject when an adjacent archetype owns the work object or completion event more precisely.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the selection rule passes. Return `reject` for `AR-MBQ-90`, `91` or `92`. Return `needs-evidence` when business truth does not prove the dominant task, owner relationship, overflow owner, or completion consequence.

## Handoff

1. Business truth supplies actors, objects, rules, permissions, state transitions, and completion consequences.
2. This archetype resolves the dominant task, region graph, responsive replacement, semantic order, and parity.
3. Grammar binds product-semantic owners to regions and states without changing topology.
4. Principles resolve exact grid, measure, gap, size, alignment, overflow, and content-fit breakpoints.
5. Direction expresses visual character inside accepted owners.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

The research below is advisory evidence, not product truth. It does not authorize copying geometry, component trees, product nouns, breakpoints, or visual treatment; every binding claim still routes through business truth, Grammar, and Principles.
