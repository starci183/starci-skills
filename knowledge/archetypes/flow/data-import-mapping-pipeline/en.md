# Data import mapping pipeline

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `data-import-mapping-pipeline` |
| Family | `flow` |
| Dominant task | Move a structured dataset through parsing, field mapping, row validation, sample review, and controlled commit. |
| Search aliases | `CSV mapping import`, `structured data import`, `field mapping pipeline` |
| Authority | Product-neutral macro topology and behavior contract. |

### Invariants

- The archetype owns only the dominant task, required regions, region relationships, responsive transformations, interaction parity, and state families.
- Grammar owns product nouns, semantic owners, domain rules, and state transitions.
- Principles own exact geometry, measure, gap, alignment, overflow values, and responsive thresholds.
- Direction owns visual character; the template is only one neutral conforming realization.
- Reading order, DOM order, and focus order retain one semantic sequence across every topology.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `IMP-01` | Move a structured dataset through parsing, field mapping, row validation, sample review, and controlled commit. | required positive |
| `IMP-02` | All required regions and their named ownership relationships are necessary for the task. | required positive |
| `IMP-03` | Wide adjacency fails while intermediate and compact transformations preserve task, state, and recovery. | conditional positive |
| `IMP-90` | Reject simple document upload or an editable data table. | reject |
| `IMP-91` | Reject file browsers or one-click centered imports without mapping and review. | reject |

### Selection rule

- Return `accept` only when `IMP-01` and `IMP-02` are evidenced and no 90–99 code is present.
- Return `reject` when `IMP-90` or `IMP-91` is evidenced, or an adjacent archetype owns the dominant task.
- Return `needs-evidence` when the task, required region, relationship, or responsive failure trigger remains unresolved.

## Region graph

```text
import-pipeline
├─ source-file-and-parse-status
├─ source-to-target-mapping
├─ validation-summary
├─ sample-preview
├─ commit-scope-and-actions
└─ import-result
```

- **Shared relationship:** Mapping and sample preview share source and target field identity; validation derives from the current mapping revision; commit consumes only the reviewed valid scope.
- `import-pipeline -> source-file-and-parse-status`: `source-file-and-parse-status` consumes the named context or revision from `import-pipeline` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `source-file-and-parse-status -> source-to-target-mapping`: `source-to-target-mapping` consumes the named context or revision from `source-file-and-parse-status` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `source-to-target-mapping -> validation-summary`: `validation-summary` consumes the named context or revision from `source-to-target-mapping` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `validation-summary -> sample-preview`: `sample-preview` consumes the named context or revision from `validation-summary` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `sample-preview -> commit-scope-and-actions`: `commit-scope-and-actions` consumes the named context or revision from `sample-preview` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.
- `commit-scope-and-actions -> import-result`: `import-result` consumes the named context or revision from `commit-scope-and-actions` and exposes an explicit return or reconciliation path.

### Region obligations

| Region | Obligation |
|---|---|
| `import-pipeline` | Owns the complete import pipeline transaction boundary, shared revision, and recovery context; child regions cannot commit outside it. |
| `source-file-and-parse-status` | Owns the derived source file and parse status state; it names its source revision and cannot contradict the input or evidence owners. |
| `source-to-target-mapping` | Owns the source to target mapping input or decision and updates the shared transaction revision while preserving its label, status, and contextual actions. |
| `validation-summary` | Owns the derived validation summary state; it names its source revision and cannot contradict the input or evidence owners. |
| `sample-preview` | Owns the derived sample preview state; it names its source revision and cannot contradict the input or evidence owners. |
| `commit-scope-and-actions` | Owns the commit scope and actions input or decision and updates the shared transaction revision while preserving its label, status, and contextual actions. |
| `import-result` | Owns the derived import result state; it names its source revision and cannot contradict the input or evidence owners. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** A required region can no longer remain simultaneous without squeezing, truncating, or separating context from action.
- **Topology response:** Mapping and sample preview remain simultaneous while one bounded table owns necessary two-dimensional overflow.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** The lowest-priority supporting region can no longer persist while retaining readable measure and action order.
- **Topology response:** Preview becomes a disclosure that retains the selected mapping while mapping remains primary.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Adjacency or multiple primary panes no longer work under zoom, localization, text growth, or short height.
- **Topology response:** The task becomes source, map fields, resolve issues, review sample, and commit with summaries and Back state.
- **Navigation replacement:** Every region that loses adjacency receives a named route to the same content and state.
- **Sticky boundary:** Persistence yields before it can obscure content, focus, validation, or actions in short-height conditions.
- **Overflow owner:** The page owns vertical overflow; only an explicitly named two-dimensional task region may own bounded overflow.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `import-pipeline` → `source-file-and-parse-status` → `source-to-target-mapping` → `validation-summary` → `sample-preview` → `commit-scope-and-actions` → `import-result`.
- CSS does not reorder regions or the focus sequence at a topology transition.
- Compact navigation replaces adjacency with a named primary pane and restores the exact trigger, state, and scroll context.

### Interaction parity

- Wide, intermediate, and compact retain the same actions, state meanings, recovery paths, and consequence.
- Dynamic status is announced without moving focus automatically.
- Error recovery moves focus to a summary or repairable field and then returns to the meaningful continuation.

## State obligations

| State | Required behavior | Responsive presentation |
|---|---|---|
| `parsing pending` | Announce progress without moving focus, preserve the current revision, and prevent only the duplicate operation. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `parsing error` | Announce progress without moving focus, preserve the current revision, and prevent only the duplicate operation. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `encoding ambiguity` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `missing field` | Explain the unavailable boundary, retain readable context, and expose an eligible alternate or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `duplicate field` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `unmapped field` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `invalid rows` | Name the cause at its owner, expose a focusable repair path, and preserve safe input for retry. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `ignored rows` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `mapping changed` | Identify the conflicting revision, block stale commitment, and reconcile without discarding unaffected state. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `preview stale` | Identify the conflicting revision, block stale commitment, and reconcile without discarding unaffected state. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `commit pending` | Announce progress without moving focus, preserve the current revision, and prevent only the duplicate operation. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `partial result` | Identify the conflicting revision, block stale commitment, and reconcile without discarding unaffected state. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `success` | Expose the confirming evidence and the next or handoff action without erasing review context. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `rollback` | Expose the state with its owner, consequence, and a deterministic continuation or recovery path. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |
| `schema conflict` | Identify the conflicting revision, block stale commitment, and reconcile without discarding unaffected state. | Wide keeps the state beside its owner; intermediate removes low-priority persistence; compact places the state and recovery in the current primary pane and restores its anchor. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Use when field identity must survive parse, mapping, validation, preview, and commit.
- Required regions must share one transaction state model and one provable recovery path.

### Reject

- Reject simple document upload or an editable data table.
- Reject file browsers or one-click centered imports without mapping and review.
- Reject when the difference is only a product noun, card count, density, color, component, or state variation.

### Boundary verdict

- Default `needs-evidence`; `accept` is valid only under the executable selection rule above.

## Handoff

- **Grammar:** Supplies product actors, nouns, semantic owners, domain rules, eligibility, transitions, and consequences.
- **Principles:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, size, alignment, overflow, sticky offsets, and content-driven thresholds.
- **Direction:** Resolve visual character without changing topology or ownership.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

The sources below are advisory comparison evidence. They are not product truth, do not select a Grammar owner, do not authorize copied geometry or component trees, and do not override Source authority.

### Sources

| Source | What it supports | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| [W3C — Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-model/) | Source columns and rows have stable identities for mapping and validation. | It does not define import UI or commit behavior. |
| [Carbon Design System — Data table usage](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/) | Dense row-column relationships may own bounded horizontal overflow. | It does not make a small record collection a data table. |
| [U.S. Web Design System — Table](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/table/) | Tabular associations need headers and bounded responsive handling. | It does not define mapping semantics or import rules. |
| [W3C WAI — Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow) | Required content reflows without page-level two-dimensional scrolling. | It does not prescribe a breakpoint or region geometry. |
