# Multi-track timeline editor

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | multi-track-timeline-editor |
| Family | work |
| Dominant task | Compose a time-based artifact by placing, trimming, and synchronizing clips across tracks before preview and render. |
| Search aliases | multi-track-timeline-editor; multi-track timeline editor |
| Authority | Dominant-task topology, region graph, responsive transformation, interaction parity, and state families. |

### Invariants

- Compose a time-based artifact by placing, trimming, and synchronizing clips across tracks before preview and render.
- Each region has one semantic owner; supporting context never takes over the dominant task.
- DOM order, reading order, and focus order preserve meaning across wide, intermediate, and compact.
- Grammar supplies product facts; Principles resolve exact geometry; the archetype does not own visual direction.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| AR-MTT-01 | Compose a time-based artifact by placing, trimming, and synchronizing clips across tracks before preview and render. | required positive evidence |
| AR-MTT-02 | Every required region and critical relationship has an independent owner. | required positive evidence |
| AR-MTT-03 | The wide relationship stops working, but compact must preserve task, state, and recovery. | transformation trigger |
| AR-MTT-90 | the page annotates media, shows audit status, schedules calendar work, pages slides, or builds a free-form canvas. | reject |
| AR-MTT-91 | The difference is only a product noun, density, color, component, or card count. | duplicate-or-variation |

### Selection rule

Return accept only when AR-MTT-01 and AR-MTT-02 are evidenced, neither AR-MTT-90 nor AR-MTT-91 is present, and the region graph remains necessary across all three topologies. Return needs-evidence when an owner or transformation is unresolved.

Critical relationship: Tracks, clips, playhead, preview, and render share the same coordinate and project version.

### Region obligations

| Region ID | Owner | Required relationship |
|---|---|---|
| timeline-editor | Owns the bounded page task and contains every required region; it does not invent product semantics. | Contains project-version-and-duration, asset-bin, multi-track-time-ruler, playhead-and-selection, clip-property-inspector, transport-preview, render-and-validation while preserving their independent owners. |
| project-version-and-duration | Owns stable subject, scope, and orientation facts for every downstream decision. | Orients asset-bin without replacing its owner. |
| asset-bin | Owns membership, item identity, status, and the current selection for this bounded collection. | Receives context from project-version-and-duration and constrains multi-track-time-ruler without merging their authorities. |
| multi-track-time-ruler | Owns ordering, coordinates, or dependency relationships without owning the underlying product facts. | Receives context from asset-bin and constrains playhead-and-selection without merging their authorities. |
| playhead-and-selection | Owns this named task fact or stage and no neighboring region's decision authority. | Receives context from multi-track-time-ruler and constrains clip-property-inspector without merging their authorities. |
| clip-property-inspector | Owns this named task fact or stage and no neighboring region's decision authority. | Receives context from playhead-and-selection and constrains transport-preview without merging their authorities. |
| transport-preview | Owns the derived interpretation or consequence preview; it never becomes a second input source. | Receives context from clip-property-inspector and constrains render-and-validation without merging their authorities. |
| render-and-validation | Owns the bounded completion, verification, or recovery transaction and prevents duplicate execution. | Consumes verified state from transport-preview and emits the bounded outcome or recovery path. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- Inspect asset bin, multi-track timeline, preview, and clip inspector together; the timeline alone owns two-axis overflow.
- Failure trigger: simultaneous regions narrow content, obscure state, or break owner relationships.
- Navigation replacement is unnecessary while regions remain simultaneous; sticky is allowed only for context that fits.
- The page owns vertical overflow; only an intrinsically two-dimensional region may own bounded overflow.

### Intermediate

- Move the asset bin to the temporary pane and alternate preview with inspector while the timeline remains primary.
- Failure trigger: supporting persistence competes with primary-task measure or focus.
- A named trigger opens the temporary pane; Escape closes it and focus returns to the trigger.
- Sticky behavior yields at short height; the page remains the overflow owner.

### Compact

- Stage track list, selected clip timeline, explicit trim controls, preview, then render review.
- Failure trigger: multiple panes are no longer simultaneously operable with 16px text and 44px targets.
- Previous, Next, and a stage selector replace pane adjacency; Back preserves selection and draft.
- No page-level horizontal scrolling is allowed; sticky or fixed surfaces never obscure content or focus.

### Reflow

The region graph order is the DOM and reading order at every width. CSS does not reorder it. Text, localization, zoom, and spacing growth increase region height or trigger a topology change; content is not clipped. Region state survives movement into and out of the temporary pane.

### Interaction parity

Wide, intermediate, and compact expose the same action, selection, pending guard, success, error, retry, stale/conflict recovery, and outcome. Dynamic status is announced through a polite live region without stealing focus. A dialog contains focus, supports Escape or cancel, and returns focus to its exact trigger.

## State obligations

Domain state catalog: assets loading/missing; clip selected/moved/trimmed/split; overlap/gap; track muted/locked; play/pause/scrub; dirty/undo-redo; render queued/progress/failure/ready; version conflict.

| State family | Obligation | Focus transition | Responsive presentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| initial/loading | Preserve known anatomy and name the waiting region. | Do not move focus automatically. | Keep the same stage identity. |
| ready | Show internally consistent, product-neutral demo data. | Focus remains at the activating control. | Preserve selection. |
| empty/not-applicable | Explain why content is empty and any valid next step. | Move to recovery only when continuation needs it. | Do not erase other required regions. |
| error/retry | Associate the error with its owner and provide bounded retry. | Multi-error moves to the summary; retry returns to the owner. | Error is not color-only. |
| permission/unavailable | Preserve orientation and explain the limitation. | Do not focus a locked control. | Use the same reason in every topology. |
| pending | Prevent duplicates and preserve the action meaning. | Do not steal focus for progress. | State stays with its action owner. |
| success | Confirm the outcome and a valid continuation. | Move focus only when it helps continuation. | Do not create a second source of truth. |
| stale/conflict | Name the changed version and preserve safe input. | Focus a contextual recovery choice. | Selection survives transformation. |
| domain states | Clip added at the playhead without changing other tracks. Selected clip moved one explicit time step; overlap is now reported. Clip trimmed; preview and output are stale until rendered. Version 4 rendered; preview, playhead, and validation share the same coordinates. | Every modal returns focus to its trigger. | Preserve action and recovery parity. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

Accept when the dominant task needs this exact region graph, its critical relationship creates a distinct topology, and all responsive states preserve task and recovery parity.

### Reject

Reject when the page annotates media, shows audit status, schedules calendar work, pages slides, or builds a free-form canvas, or when the candidate only changes nouns, cards, or density from another archetype.

### Boundary verdict

The valid result is accept, reject, duplicate-or-variation, or needs-evidence under the Situation-code rule; visual preference is not evidence.

## Handoff

- Grammar receives real facts, semantic owners, permissions, states, and action consequences.
- Principles receives exact grid, measure, gaps, sizing, alignment, overflow, thresholds, sticky offsets, and focus accommodation.
- Direction receives visual character; the template is only one conforming realization.
