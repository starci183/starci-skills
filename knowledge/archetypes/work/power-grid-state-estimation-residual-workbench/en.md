## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `power-grid-state-estimation-residual-workbench` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Produce and qualify one electrical network state by reconciling switch topology and weighted telemetry through observability analysis, then tracing normalized measurement residuals to bad data or model errors and proving the effect of each correction by rerun. |
| Search aliases | `power`, `state`, `estimation`, `residual`, `workbench` |
| Authority | Shared, product-neutral macro topology. |

### Invariants

- The dominant task remains: Produce and qualify one electrical network state by reconciling switch topology and weighted telemetry through observability analysis, then tracing normalized measurement residuals to bad data or model errors and proving the effect of each correction by rerun.
- The required region graph remains `grid-state-estimation → estimator-run-network-model-and-time-version → breaker-switch-topology-processor → electrical-island-and-measurement-adjacency-graph ↔ telemetry-value-quality-weight-and-age-register → observability-and-critical-measurement-analysis → estimated-bus-voltage-angle-and-branch-flow-state → measured-versus-predicted-normalized-residual-ledger → bad-data-or-topology-error-hypothesis → suppress-correct-or-model-change-trial → rerun-and-residual-propagation-comparison → accepted-state-and-telemetry-model-work-queue`.
- The mandatory relationship remains: the shared estimate predicts every measurement, while a correction is credible only when its residual effect propagates coherently through the connected electrical neighborhood.
- DOM order, reading order, and meaningful focus order remain identical.
- Grammar owns product meaning; Principles own unresolved geometry; Direction owns visual character.
- Every realization preserves this acceptance proof: Template must process a fictional switch topology, expose one unobservable island or critical-measurement loss, rank normalized residuals, compare a bad-telemetry hypothesis with a switch-status hypothesis, run a reversible correction and accept the state only after convergence, observability and connected-neighborhood residuals improve.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-B13-06-01` | The dominant task and authority match in full. | Candidate evidence. |
| `AR-B13-06-02` | The complete required region graph is present in semantic order. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-B13-06-03` | Wide, intermediate, and compact preserve the same task, selection, state, and recovery. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-B13-06-04` | The mandatory relationship is evidenced with traceable records. | Required relationship evidence. |
| `AR-B13-06-05` | The acceptance focus works by keyboard and exposes fail, repair, rerun, and success states. | Required interaction evidence. |
| `AR-B13-06-90` | The dominant task is actually `reconciliation-diff-workbench`. | Reject. |
| `AR-B13-06-91` | The dominant task is actually `dependency-topology-monitor`. | Reject. |
| `AR-B13-06-99` | The candidate changes only a product noun, count, density, color, component, or state. | `duplicate-or-variation`. |

### Selection rule

Select `power-grid-state-estimation-residual-workbench` only when `AR-B13-06-01` through `AR-B13-06-05` are evidenced and none of `AR-B13-06-90` through `AR-B13-06-99` holds. Return `needs-evidence` when a mandatory owner or relationship is unknown. Return `reject` when any rejection code holds.

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous evidence owners cannot retain readable labels, exact cross-region associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Processed topology, measurement adjacency, observability result, estimated state, residual ranking, active hypothesis and before/after rerun remain simultaneously inspectable.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while every simultaneous owner remains usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only the active action may persist; it reserves space and yields when short height cannot keep focus visible.
- **Overflow owner:** Only the designated table, graph, timeline, or matrix evidence region may own bounded overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority persistent region makes the dominant relationship unreadable or inoperable.
- **Topology response:** The selected island or residual and its connected measurement/model neighborhood remain primary; full topology, complete telemetry roster and prior trials move to synchronized routes.
- **Navigation replacement:** A named route exposes each displaced region with the current selection and state intact.
- **Sticky boundary:** A persistent action remains only while its target and status are visible; it returns to flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The bounded evidence region retains overflow; prose and controls reflow.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two simultaneous task regions cannot preserve readable evidence and 44-by-44 CSS-pixel controls.
- **Topology response:** Estimator run and island → observability gap or worst normalized residual → connected measurements and switch statuses → measured-versus-predicted evidence → bad-datum or topology hypothesis → reversible trial → rerun and neighborhood residual propagation → accept state or open work item; the network transforms into an adjacency path plus ranked residual route.
- **Navigation replacement:** Explicit Previous, Next, and named-step controls restore selection, state, and scroll context.
- **Sticky boundary:** The step control reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** Only essential table or graph evidence remains bounded; all other content uses page scrolling.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `grid-state-estimation → estimator-run-network-model-and-time-version → breaker-switch-topology-processor → electrical-island-and-measurement-adjacency-graph ↔ telemetry-value-quality-weight-and-age-register → observability-and-critical-measurement-analysis → estimated-bus-voltage-angle-and-branch-flow-state → measured-versus-predicted-normalized-residual-ledger → bad-data-or-topology-error-hypothesis → suppress-correct-or-model-change-trial → rerun-and-residual-propagation-comparison → accepted-state-and-telemetry-model-work-queue`.
- Text zoom, long translation, and enlarged controls trigger the same relationship-driven topology changes.
- CSS never reorders the visual sequence away from keyboard or assistive-technology order.
- Long labels wrap and every hidden region has a named accessible reveal path.
- Ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scrolling.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, evidence view, action, retry, and recovery remains reachable in intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact selected item, causal path, data state, and pending or completed receipt.
- Dynamic updates announce one contextual status without stealing focus.
- Color, position, geometry, and visual marks have textual or tabular equivalents.
- The acceptance path remains: Template must process a fictional switch topology, expose one unobservable island or critical-measurement loss, rank normalized residuals, compare a bad-telemetry hypothesis with a switch-status hypothesis, run a reversible correction and accept the state only after convergence, observability and connected-neighborhood residuals improve.

## State obligations

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `estimator-run-network-model-and-time-version` | Identify the pending owner and preserve its semantic position. |
| Ready | `breaker-switch-topology-processor` | Expose the complete dominant task and synchronized evidence. |
| Empty / not applicable | `electrical-island-and-measurement-adjacency-graph` | Distinguish meaningful absence from unavailable evidence. |
| Error / retry | `telemetry-value-quality-weight-and-age-register` | Keep valid context and offer a local retry without resetting selection. |
| Permission / unavailable | `observability-and-critical-measurement-analysis` | Do not imply hidden evidence is absent; provide a safe alternate route. |
| Pending | `rerun-and-residual-propagation-comparison` | Prevent duplicate action and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `accepted-state-and-telemetry-model-work-queue` | Expose the receipt, preserve context, and provide the next valid action. |
| Stale / conflict | `estimator-run-network-model-and-time-version` | Keep the last safe value and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `accepted-state-and-telemetry-model-work-queue` | Move focus only for a modal or error summary, then return it to the trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `grid-state-estimation` | Preserve selection, state, and recovery when topology changes. |

Applicable state family: model loading/current/stale, topology processed/inconsistent, telemetry current/stale/missing/suspect/excluded, island observable/unobservable/weakly observable, estimator queued/converged/nonconvergent, residual within/warning/outlier, critical measurement present/lost, hypothesis untested/supported/rejected, correction draft/applied/rolled-back, rerun improved/regressed and state provisional/accepted/rejected.

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when the dominant task is: Produce and qualify one electrical network state by reconciling switch topology and weighted telemetry through observability analysis, then tracing normalized measurement residuals to bad data or model errors and proving the effect of each correction by rerun.
- Accept when the complete region graph and mandatory relationship are evidenced together.
- Accept when compact preserves the exact task evidence, action, and recovery.

### Reject

- Reject cho `reconciliation-diff-workbench`, `dependency-topology-monitor`, anomaly dashboard or generic data-quality table; electrical observability, weighted measurements, a solved voltage/angle state, measured-versus-predicted normalized residuals, bad-data-versus-topology hypotheses and causal rerun propagation are mandatory.
- Reject a candidate whose only difference is product noun, count, density, color, component, or state as `duplicate-or-variation`.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete region graph, mandatory owner relationship, and compact interaction parity all hold. Return `reject` for any rejection code. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unresolved.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permissions, actions, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow realization, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.
