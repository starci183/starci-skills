## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `railway-movement-authority-control-console` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Establish, transmit, supervise and release one train movement authority whose safe limit derives from track occupancy, route and point locking, train integrity, speed restrictions and braking distance. |
| Search aliases | `railway movement authority control`, `railway movement authority control workspace`, `railway movement authority control control` |
| Authority | Shared product-neutral macro topology; Grammar owns product semantics, Principles own unresolved geometry, and Direction owns visual character. |

### Invariants

- Establish, transmit, supervise and release one train movement authority whose safe limit derives from track occupancy, route and point locking, train integrity, speed restrictions and braking distance.
- a block is released only behind the proven rear of this train, never merely because a possession window ended.
- Every required region retains a separate owner and the same selected context.
- Wide, intermediate, and compact preserve meaningful DOM, reading, and focus order, action parity, and deterministic recovery.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-RMACC-01` | The dominant task is the required observable outcome. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-RMACC-02` | The complete required region graph and named relationships are necessary. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-RMACC-03` | Compact preserves wide actions, state, recovery, and focus meaning. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-RMACC-04` | Task-specific state can change after the user creates work state. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-RMACC-90` | The dominant task is actually `rail-possession-access-planner`. | Reject. |
| `AR-RMACC-91` | The dominant task is actually `dependency-topology-monitor`. | Reject. |
| `AR-RMACC-92` | The dominant task is actually `permit-to-work-isolation-control-room`. | Reject. |
| `AR-RMACC-93` | The dominant task is actually `air-traffic-separation-resolution-console`. | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `railway-movement-authority-control-console` if and only if `AR-RMACC-01` through `AR-RMACC-04` are evidenced and none of `AR-RMACC-90` through `AR-RMACC-93` holds. Return `needs-evidence` when an owner or relationship is unresolved; return `reject` when a rejection code holds.

## Region graph

```text

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner and relationship obligation |
|---|---|
| `movement-control` | Owns the dominant task, all descendant state, and the recovery boundary. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous regions can no longer retain readable labels, exact associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Block topology, selected train, route locks, authority envelope, braking/conflict evidence and transmit/acknowledgement ledger remain visible as one control surface.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while every required region remains simultaneously usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current-task status or action may persist; it reserves space and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `discrete-track-block-topology` owns bounded overflow; the page owns no horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority supporting region makes the primary relationship unusable.
- **Topology response:** The selected train and proposed authority remain primary; topology and braking/lock evidence alternate while transmission state stays persistent until acknowledged.
- **Navigation replacement:** Named evidence views replace displaced regions and preserve exact selection and trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** The current verdict persists only while its target remains visible and returns to flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The wide bounded owner remains local; alternate evidence views create no nested page scroll.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two task regions cannot simultaneously preserve readable evidence, 44-pixel targets, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Named train and integrity → locked route/block chain → moving authority limit and speed-distance braking curve → stop-before-limit proof → transmit and driver acknowledgement → train-front advance → rear-clear proof → release each block progressively; a textual block chain replaces the signalling diagram.
- **Navigation replacement:** A primary-pane sequence with Back restores selection, state, query, scroll context, and the exact trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** The action bar reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The bounded visual has a textual ordered equivalent as the primary compact representation.

### Reflow

- Semantic, DOM, and meaningful focus order preserve the graph: `movement-control → control-area-operating-mode-and-rule-version → discrete-track-block-topology ↔ train-identity-position-direction-integrity-and-braking-model → route-lock-and-point-state → train-specific-moving-authority-envelope-with-speed-distance-braking-curve → occupancy-and-stop-before-limit-proof → issue-transmit-driver-acknowledgement → supervised-train-front-progression-and-rear-integrity → progressive-block-by-block-release → authority-close-or-degraded-mode-log`.
- Long labels, translation, zoom, and enlarged controls trigger the same named topology changes.
- CSS never reorders semantics; ordinary content creates no page-level horizontal scroll.
- Hidden detail always has an explicit accessible reveal path.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, edit, action, explanation, retry, and recovery remains reachable at intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact selected object, order, data state, pending result, and error context.
- Pointer actions have keyboard and single-pointer non-drag equivalents when movement is involved.
- Dynamic updates announce one contextual status without stealing focus; color is never the only signal.
- A modal receives and contains focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.

## State obligations

Task-specific states: Occupancy unknown/clear/occupied, train position fresh/stale, integrity confirmed/unknown, points normal/reverse/failed, route unlocked/setting/locked, authority proposed/conflicting/valid/transmitted/acknowledged, train stationary/moving/overrun risk, block released, authority shortened/cancelled and degraded verbal procedure active.

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `control-area-operating-mode-and-rule-version` | Name the loading scope, reserve the primary region, and block only the failed owner. |
| Ready | `discrete-track-block-topology` | Expose the current object, owner relationship, selection, and valid action in text and semantics. |
| Empty / not applicable | `discrete-track-block-topology` | Distinguish true empty, no-match, and non-applicable states and provide the valid next action. |
| Error / retry | `progressive-block-by-block-release` | Keep valid context and input, name the failed owner, and provide local retry. |
| Permission / unavailable | `authority-close-or-degraded-mode-log` | Explain the restriction without implying hidden evidence is absent and provide a safe exit. |
| Pending | `authority-close-or-degraded-mode-log` | Prevent duplicate action, retain the exact target, and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `authority-close-or-degraded-mode-log` | Confirm the exact outcome, preserve selection, and provide the next valid action or recovery. |
| Stale / conflict | `control-area-operating-mode-and-rule-version` | Keep the last safe value, identify the version or time conflict, and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `authority-close-or-degraded-mode-log` | Move focus only to a modal or required error summary, then return it to the exact trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `movement-control` | Preserve state, selection, query, pending result, and recovery when topology changes. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when the dominant task is: Establish, transmit, supervise and release one train movement authority whose safe limit derives from track occupancy, route and point locking, train integrity, speed restrictions and braking distance.
- Accept when every required region and relationship in the graph is necessary to complete the task.
- Accept when compact preserves task, state, and recovery through a replacement topology instead of stacking desktop boxes.

### Reject

- Reject `rail-possession-access-planner`; this is `AR-RMACC-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `dependency-topology-monitor`; this is `AR-RMACC-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `permit-to-work-isolation-control-room`; this is `AR-RMACC-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `air-traffic-separation-resolution-console`; this is `AR-RMACC-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete graph, and compact parity all hold. Differences limited to noun, density, color, component, card count, or state are `duplicate-or-variation`.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permitted actions, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

External research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It supports synthesis of task relationships, adaptive behavior, and accessibility obligations; it does not select StarCi owners, exact geometry, or permission to copy a source interface.
