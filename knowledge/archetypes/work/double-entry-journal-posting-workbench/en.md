# Double-entry journal posting workbench

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `double-entry-journal-posting-workbench` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Convert one evidenced accounting event into an authorized, balanced journal batch, post it once to the correct book and period, and preserve corrections as new reversal or adjustment lineage. |
| Search aliases | `double-entry posting`, `journal composer`, `ledger posting`, `balanced journal` |
| Authority | Shared, product-neutral macro topology. |

### Invariants

- The dominant task remains: Convert one evidenced accounting event into an authorized, balanced journal batch, post it once to the correct book and period, and preserve corrections as new reversal or adjustment lineage.
- The complete region graph retains every stable English region ID declared below.
- Required relationship: Debit and credit totals are independent global owners by book and currency; equality, counter-entry navigation, period control, approval, immutable posting identity, and correction-by-new-lineage are all required.
- DOM order, reading order, and meaningful focus order remain identical.
- Grammar owns product meaning; Principles own unresolved exact geometry; Direction owns visual character.
- Every state family preserves task, selection, action, and recovery.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-DJ-01` | The dominant task matches Identity exactly. | Candidate evidence. |
| `AR-DJ-02` | The complete required region graph is present. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-DJ-03` | Compact retains wide action, state, recovery, and associations. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-DJ-04` | Debit and credit totals are independent global owners by book and currency; equality, counter-entry navigation, period control, approval, immutable posting identity, and correction-by-new-lineage are all required. | Preserve as an invariant. |
| `AR-DJ-90` | The dominant task is  review-submit-ledger. | Reject. |
| `AR-DJ-91` | The dominant task is  reconciliation-diff-workbench. | Reject. |
| `AR-DJ-92` | The dominant task is  spreadsheet-grid-editor. | Reject. |
| `AR-DJ-93` | The dominant task is  generic form approval or any allocator that distributes one source total. | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `double-entry-journal-posting-workbench` only when `AR-DJ-01`, `AR-DJ-02`, and `AR-DJ-03` are evidenced and no rejection code holds. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unknown; return `reject` for rejection evidence; a difference limited to noun, count, density, color, component, or state is `duplicate-or-variation`.

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `journal-posting` | Owns the evidence, action, and state of `journal-posting` without borrowing product semantics. | Root of the graph. |
| `book-entity-period-and-policy-version` | Owns the evidence, action, and state of `book-entity-period-and-policy-version` without borrowing product semantics. | Follows the graph semantic order and retains its association with `journal-posting`. |
| `source-event-and-document-lineage` | Owns the evidence, action, and state of `source-event-and-document-lineage` without borrowing product semantics. | Follows the graph semantic order and retains its association with `book-entity-period-and-policy-version`. |
| `journal-header` | Owns the evidence, action, and state of `journal-header` without borrowing product semantics. | Follows the graph semantic order and retains its association with `source-event-and-document-lineage`. |
| `debit-credit-line-composer` | Owns the evidence, action, and state of `debit-credit-line-composer` without borrowing product semantics. | Follows the graph semantic order and retains its association with `journal-header`. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous regions can no longer retain readable labels, exact associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Keep source evidence, journal lines, account eligibility, independent debit and credit totals, approval ownership, and posting preview simultaneously inspectable.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while all required regions remain simultaneously usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only the active cross-region action may persist; it reserves space and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `debit-credit-line-composer` is the sole bounded horizontal overflow owner when needed.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority supporting region makes the primary relationship unusable.
- **Topology response:** Keep journal lines and the balance receipt primary; move source documents, account guidance, and approval history into synchronized disclosures that retain the selected line.
- **Navigation replacement:** A named disclosure opens the displaced region and retains the exact selection.
- **Sticky boundary:** An action persists only while its exact target and status remain visible; it returns to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The wide bounded owner retains the only axis and exposes a keyboard alternative.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two simultaneous task regions cannot retain readable evidence and 44-by-44 CSS-pixel controls.
- **Topology response:** Sequence event, header, one debit or credit line, its counter-entry set, persistent partition totals, failure resolution, approval, post receipt, and reversal; do not reduce the task to a single-total allocator.
- **Navigation replacement:** A primary-pane sequence with Back and Next restores selection, state, and scroll context.
- **Sticky boundary:** The bottom action reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** A numeric or list equivalent replaces the bounded grid; no page-level horizontal scroll appears.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `journal-posting` → `book-entity-period-and-policy-version` → `source-event-and-document-lineage` → `journal-header` → `debit-credit-line-composer` → `account-dimension-eligibility-and-tax-rules` → `debit-total-by-book-and-currency` → `credit-total-by-book-and-currency` → `counter-entry-navigation-and-batch-balance-receipt` → `segregation-review-and-approval` → `immutable-posting-to-ledger` → `reversal-correction-and-close-lineage`.
- Zoom, long translation, enlarged controls, and text pressure trigger the same topology transformations.
- CSS does not reorder the visual sequence away from keyboard or assistive-technology order.
- Ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scrolling.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, action, explanation, retry, and recovery remains reachable in intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact entity, filters, data state, and pending or completed result.
- Dynamic updates announce contextual status without stealing focus.
- Any modal traps focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.
- Color, position, and geometry have a textual or structural equivalent.

## State obligations

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `book-entity-period-and-policy-version` | Name the scope and pending owner; preserve semantic position. |
| Ready | `source-event-and-document-lineage` | Expose the complete dominant task and required associations. |
| Empty / not applicable | `journal-header` | Distinguish meaningful absence from unavailable evidence. |
| Error / retry | `debit-credit-line-composer` | Keep valid context, name the failed owner, and offer local retry. |
| Permission / unavailable | `immutable-posting-to-ledger` | Do not imply hidden evidence is absent; provide a safe exit. |
| Pending | `immutable-posting-to-ledger` | Prevent duplicate action, retain the exact target, and announce progress. |
| Success | `reversal-correction-and-close-lineage` | Expose the outcome, preserve context, and provide the next valid action. |
| Stale / conflict | `book-entity-period-and-policy-version` | Keep the last safe value and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `reversal-correction-and-close-lineage` | Move focus only to a modal or error summary, then return to the exact trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `journal-posting` | Preserve task, state, selection, and recovery when topology changes. |

Applicable state family: source pending/verified/rejected; book open/soft-closed/closed; journal draft/unbalanced/balanced; account eligible/blocked; dimension missing; currency imbalance; review pending/approved/rejected; posting queued/posted/duplicate-blocked; reversal scheduled/completed; ledger version superseded.

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when Independent debit and credit totals exist for every book and currency partition.
- Accept when Each line can navigate to its balancing counter-entry set.
- Accept when Posting is immutable and correction creates linked lineage.

### Reject

- Reject `review-submit-ledger`; this is `AR-DJ-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `reconciliation-diff-workbench`; this is `AR-DJ-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `spreadsheet-grid-editor`; this is `AR-DJ-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `generic form approval or any allocator that distributes one source total`; this is `AR-DJ-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete region graph, and compact interaction parity all hold. Return `reject` for any rejection code. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unresolved. Apply `duplicate-or-variation` when the difference is limited to noun, count, density, color, component, or state.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permitted actions, eligibility, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, size, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

External research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It supports synthesis of task relationships, responsive behavior, and accessibility obligations; it does not name StarCi owners, select exact geometry, or grant permission to copy an interface.
