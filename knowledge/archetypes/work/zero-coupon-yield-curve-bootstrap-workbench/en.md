# Zero-coupon yield curve bootstrap workbench

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `zero-coupon-yield-curve-bootstrap-workbench` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Build one dated zero-coupon curve by solving market instruments in maturity dependency order, then prove the resulting discount factors reprice the input set within declared tolerances. |
| Search aliases | `curve bootstrap`, `discount-factor solver`, `maturity-node curve`, `instrument repricing` |
| Authority | Shared, product-neutral macro topology. |

### Invariants

- The dominant task remains: Build one dated zero-coupon curve by solving market instruments in maturity dependency order, then prove the resulting discount factors reprice the input set within declared tolerances.
- The complete region graph retains every stable English region ID declared below.
- Required relationship: Every solved maturity node extends the known curve segment and owns discounting for later cash flows; publication requires repricing and arbitrage diagnostics to pass.
- DOM order, reading order, and meaningful focus order remain identical.
- Grammar owns product meaning; Principles own unresolved exact geometry; Direction owns visual character.
- Every state family preserves task, selection, action, and recovery.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-YC-01` | The dominant task matches Identity exactly. | Candidate evidence. |
| `AR-YC-02` | The complete required region graph is present. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-YC-03` | Compact retains wide action, state, recovery, and associations. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-YC-04` | Every solved maturity node extends the known curve segment and owns discounting for later cash flows; publication requires repricing and arbitrage diagnostics to pass. | Preserve as an invariant. |
| `AR-YC-90` | The dominant task is  scenario-sensitivity-modeler. | Reject. |
| `AR-YC-91` | The dominant task is  calculation-estimate-flow. | Reject. |
| `AR-YC-92` | The dominant task is  chart-specification-authoring-studio. | Reject. |
| `AR-YC-93` | The dominant task is  generic rate dashboard. | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `zero-coupon-yield-curve-bootstrap-workbench` only when `AR-YC-01`, `AR-YC-02`, and `AR-YC-03` are evidenced and no rejection code holds. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unknown; return `reject` for rejection evidence; a difference limited to noun, count, density, color, component, or state is `duplicate-or-variation`.

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `curve-bootstrap` | Owns the evidence, action, and state of `curve-bootstrap` without borrowing product semantics. | Root of the graph. |
| `valuation-date-currency-collateral-and-convention-set` | Owns the evidence, action, and state of `valuation-date-currency-collateral-and-convention-set` without borrowing product semantics. | Follows the graph semantic order and retains its association with `curve-bootstrap`. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous regions can no longer retain readable labels, exact associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Keep the instrument ladder, dependency nodes, selected equation, curve representations, and repricing residuals simultaneously inspectable.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while all required regions remain simultaneously usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only the active cross-region action may persist; it reserves space and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `market-instrument-ladder` is the sole bounded horizontal overflow owner when needed.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority supporting region makes the primary relationship unusable.
- **Topology response:** Keep the active maturity node, equation, and residual primary; expose full cash flows, interpolation controls, and whole-curve diagnostics through contextual disclosures.
- **Navigation replacement:** A named disclosure opens the displaced region and retains the exact selection.
- **Sticky boundary:** An action persists only while its exact target and status remain visible; it returns to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The wide bounded owner retains the only axis and exposes a keyboard alternative.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two simultaneous task regions cannot retain readable evidence and 44-by-44 CSS-pixel controls.
- **Topology response:** Sequence convention set, next unsolved maturity, instrument, known and unknown cash flows, node solve, residual and monotonicity review, then advance or rollback; replace the chart with a numeric node route.
- **Navigation replacement:** A primary-pane sequence with Back and Next restores selection, state, and scroll context.
- **Sticky boundary:** The bottom action reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** A numeric or list equivalent replaces the bounded grid; no page-level horizontal scroll appears.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `curve-bootstrap` → `valuation-date-currency-collateral-and-convention-set` → `market-instrument-ladder` → `instrument-cashflow-expansion` → `dependency-ordered-maturity-nodes` → `selected-node-equation-and-known-discount-factors` → `solver-and-interpolation-policy` → `zero-discount-forward-curve` → `repricing-residual-and-arbitrage-diagnostics` → `approved-curve-version`.
- Zoom, long translation, enlarged controls, and text pressure trigger the same topology transformations.
- CSS does not reorder the visual sequence away from keyboard or assistive-technology order.
- Ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scrolling.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, action, explanation, retry, and recovery remains reachable in intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact entity, filters, data state, and pending or completed result.
- Dynamic updates announce contextual status without stealing focus.
- Any modal traps focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.
- Color, position, and geometry have a textual or structural equivalent.

## State obligations

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `valuation-date-currency-collateral-and-convention-set` | Name the scope and pending owner; preserve semantic position. |
| Ready | `market-instrument-ladder` | Expose the complete dominant task and required associations. |
| Empty / not applicable | `instrument-cashflow-expansion` | Distinguish meaningful absence from unavailable evidence. |
| Error / retry | `dependency-ordered-maturity-nodes` | Keep valid context, name the failed owner, and offer local retry. |
| Permission / unavailable | `repricing-residual-and-arbitrage-diagnostics` | Do not imply hidden evidence is absent; provide a safe exit. |
| Pending | `repricing-residual-and-arbitrage-diagnostics` | Prevent duplicate action, retain the exact target, and announce progress. |
| Success | `approved-curve-version` | Expose the outcome, preserve context, and provide the next valid action. |
| Stale / conflict | `valuation-date-currency-collateral-and-convention-set` | Keep the last safe value and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `approved-curve-version` | Move focus only to a modal or error summary, then return to the exact trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `curve-bootstrap` | Preserve task, state, selection, and recovery when topology changes. |

Applicable state family: market data loading/current/stale; instrument included/excluded/invalid; convention incomplete; dependency blocked; node unsolved/solving/solved/failed; discount factor invalid; interpolation discontinuity; repricing inside/outside tolerance; arbitrage warning; curve draft/approved/superseded; rollback complete.

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when Cash flows expand before node solving.
- Accept when Maturity dependencies determine solve order.
- Accept when Every included instrument receives a repricing residual before publication.

### Reject

- Reject `scenario-sensitivity-modeler`; this is `AR-YC-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `calculation-estimate-flow`; this is `AR-YC-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `chart-specification-authoring-studio`; this is `AR-YC-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `generic rate dashboard`; this is `AR-YC-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete region graph, and compact interaction parity all hold. Return `reject` for any rejection code. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unresolved. Apply `duplicate-or-variation` when the difference is limited to noun, count, density, color, component, or state.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permitted actions, eligibility, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, size, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

External research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It supports synthesis of task relationships, responsive behavior, and accessibility obligations; it does not name StarCi owners, select exact geometry, or grant permission to copy an interface.
