None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `astronomical-observation-sequence-planner` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Compose an executable observation sequence under target visibility, atmospheric, instrument, and exposure constraints. |
| Search aliases | `observation sequence`, `telescope planning`, `visibility window`, `exposure plan` |
| Authority | Shared, product-neutral macro topology. |

### Invariants

- Visibility windows and ordered exposures jointly own feasibility; target and instrument context constrain every sequence step.
- The required region graph remains `observation-planner → proposal-and-target-context → target-catalog → sky-and-visibility-windows → ephemeris-and-constraints → instrument-configuration → ordered-exposure-sequence → feasibility-and-time-budget → validate-and-export`.
- DOM order, reading order, and meaningful focus order remain identical.
- Grammar owns product meaning; Principles own unresolved geometry; Direction owns visual character.
- Loading, ready, empty, error, unavailable, pending, success, and stale or conflict states preserve the dominant task.
- Celestial visibility and ordered instrument exposures must jointly determine validity.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-AO-01` | The dominant task is: Compose an executable observation sequence under target visibility, atmospheric, instrument, and exposure constraints. | Candidate evidence. |
| `AR-AO-02` | The complete required region graph is semantically present. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-AO-03` | Compact preserves the wide selection, action, state, and recovery. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-AO-04` | Celestial visibility and ordered instrument exposures must jointly determine validity. | Required relationship evidence. |
| `AR-AO-90` | The dominant task is calendar resource scheduler. | Reject. |
| `AR-AO-91` | The dominant task is route itinerary. | Reject. |
| `AR-AO-92` | The dominant task is generic workflow. | Reject. |
| `AR-AO-93` | The dominant task is media timeline. | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `astronomical-observation-sequence-planner` only when `AR-AO-01`, `AR-AO-02`, `AR-AO-03`, and `AR-AO-04` are evidenced and none of the `AR-AO-90` through `AR-AO-93` rejection codes holds. Return `needs-evidence` when one required owner or relationship is unknown. Return `reject` when any rejection code holds.

## Region graph

```text
observation-planner
└─ proposal-and-target-context
   └─ target-catalog
      └─ sky-and-visibility-windows
         └─ ephemeris-and-constraints
            └─ instrument-configuration
               └─ ordered-exposure-sequence
                  └─ feasibility-and-time-budget
                     └─ validate-and-export
```

- Required relationship: Visibility windows and ordered exposures jointly own feasibility; target and instrument context constrain every sequence step.

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `observation-planner` | Owns the page-level dominant task and all descendant state. | Root of the graph. |
| `proposal-and-target-context` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for proposal and target context without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `observation-planner` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `target-catalog` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for target catalog without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `proposal-and-target-context` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `sky-and-visibility-windows` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for sky and visibility windows without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `target-catalog` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `ephemeris-and-constraints` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for ephemeris and constraints without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `sky-and-visibility-windows` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `instrument-configuration` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for instrument configuration without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `ephemeris-and-constraints` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `ordered-exposure-sequence` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for ordered exposure sequence without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `instrument-configuration` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `feasibility-and-time-budget` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for feasibility and time budget without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `ordered-exposure-sequence` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `validate-and-export` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for validate and export without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `feasibility-and-time-budget` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous evidence owners cannot retain readable labels, exact cross-region associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Keep visibility evidence, target or configuration inspection, and the exposure sequence visible.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while every simultaneous owner remains usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only the active cross-region action may persist; it reserves space and yields when short height cannot keep focus visible.
- **Overflow owner:** `sky-and-visibility-windows` alone may own bounded two-dimensional overflow when its task meaning requires it.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority persistent region makes the dominant relationship unreadable or inoperable.
- **Topology response:** Collapse the target catalog while visibility summary and ordered sequence remain primary.
- **Navigation replacement:** A named pane control exposes the displaced region with the current selection and state intact.
- **Sticky boundary:** A persistent action remains only while its target and status are visible; it returns to flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `sky-and-visibility-windows` retains its bounded overflow; displaced prose and controls reflow.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two simultaneous task regions cannot preserve readable evidence and 44-by-44 CSS-pixel controls.
- **Topology response:** Use target → visibility window → instrument setup → exposures → feasibility review; move controls replace drag and preserve the selected target.
- **Navigation replacement:** Explicit Previous, Next, and named-pane controls restore selection, state, and scroll context.
- **Sticky boundary:** The compact step control reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `sky-and-visibility-windows` remains the only bounded exception; all other content uses page scrolling.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `observation-planner → proposal-and-target-context → target-catalog → sky-and-visibility-windows → ephemeris-and-constraints → instrument-configuration → ordered-exposure-sequence → feasibility-and-time-budget → validate-and-export`.
- Text zoom, long translation, and enlarged controls trigger the same relationship-driven topology changes.
- CSS never reorders the visual sequence away from keyboard or assistive-technology order.
- Long labels wrap and every hidden region has a named accessible reveal path.
- Ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scrolling.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, measurement, action, retry, and recovery path remains reachable in intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact selected item, shared coordinate or path, data state, and pending or completed receipt.
- Dynamic updates announce one contextual status without stealing focus.
- A modal traps focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.
- Color, position, geometry, and visual marks have textual or tabular equivalents.
- The fictional sequence fails until exposure time fits the visibility window.

## State obligations

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `proposal-and-target-context` | Identify the pending owner and preserve its semantic position. |
| Ready | `target-catalog` | Expose the complete dominant task and synchronized evidence. |
| Empty / not applicable | `sky-and-visibility-windows` | Distinguish meaningful absence from unavailable evidence. |
| Error / retry | `ephemeris-and-constraints` | Keep valid context and offer a local retry without resetting selection. |
| Permission / unavailable | `instrument-configuration` | Do not imply hidden evidence is absent; provide a safe alternate route. |
| Pending | `validate-and-export` | Prevent duplicate action and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `validate-and-export` | Expose the result, preserve context, and provide the next valid action. |
| Stale / conflict | `proposal-and-target-context` | Keep the last safe value and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `validate-and-export` | Move focus only for a modal or error summary, then return it to the trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `observation-planner` | Preserve selection, state, and recovery when topology changes. |

Applicable state family: target unavailable, window open, window closed, window partial, weather unknown, instrument invalid, exposure over budget, sequence conflict, validation pending, validation pass, validation fail, export version conflict.

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when compose an executable observation sequence under target visibility, atmospheric, instrument, and exposure constraints.
- Accept when visibility windows and ordered exposures jointly own feasibility; target and instrument context constrain every sequence step.
- Accept when compact preserves the exact task evidence, action, and recovery.

### Reject

- Reject calendar resource scheduler; this is `AR-AO-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject route itinerary; this is `AR-AO-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject generic workflow; this is `AR-AO-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject media timeline; this is `AR-AO-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject a candidate whose only difference is product noun, count, density, color, component, or state as `duplicate-or-variation`.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete region graph, mandatory owner relationship, and compact interaction parity all hold. Return `reject` for any rejection code. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unresolved.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permissions, actions, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow realization, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

External research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It supports task relationships, adaptive behavior, and accessibility obligations; it does not name StarCi owners, select exact geometry, or grant permission to copy a source interface. The sources were opened and verified as current official pages during this batch.

### Sources

| Source | What it supports | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| [ESO — Observing tools and services](https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/tools.html) | Supports visibility, exposure-time, weather, and preparation constraints. | Does not select this archetype, define product truth, or authorize copied geometry. |
| [NRAO — Observation Preparation Tool](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/opt2010/basics/webapp) | Supports ordered scans, instrument resources, and validation. | Does not select this archetype, define product truth, or authorize copied geometry. |
| [NASA — Models and simulations standard](https://standards.nasa.gov/standard/nasa/nasa-std-7009) | Supports independent evidence and constraint records. | Does not select this archetype, define product truth, or authorize copied geometry. |
| [W3C WAI — Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order.html) | Supports keyboard sequence and responsive focus order. | Does not select this archetype, define product truth, or authorize copied geometry. |

The source set represents at least three independent official organizations and includes W3C accessibility evidence.
