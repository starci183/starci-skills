## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `exchange-volatility-auction-reopening-console` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Control one instrument from a volatility-triggered trading pause through a transparent reopening auction, deriving indicative price and imbalance, applying extension rules, uncrossing once, and returning to the correct trading state. |
| Search aliases | `volatility reopening auction`, `LULD pause console`, `indicative match imbalance`, `auction uncross receipt` |
| Authority | This record defines shared, product-neutral macro topology. |

### Invariants

- The dominant task remains: Control one instrument from a volatility-triggered trading pause through a transparent reopening auction, deriving indicative price and imbalance, applying extension rules, uncrossing once, and returning to the correct trading state.
- The required region graph remains: `volatility-reopening → venue-instrument-session-rule-and-clock-version → reference-price-and-dynamic-price-bands → triggering-trade-or-quote-and-halt-reason → auction-order-book[price-time-side-quantity] ↔ indicative-match-price-executable-volume-and-imbalance → order-entry-cancel-freeze-and-extension-gates → uncross-allocation-and-residual-book → reopening-trade-and-price-band-reset → continuous-trading-state-and-surveillance-receipt`.
- Auction orders jointly own one indicative clearing state; reopening waits for clock, price-range, imbalance, and extension gates before one deterministic uncross.
- DOM order, reading order, and meaningful focus order remain identical.
- Grammar owns product semantics; Principles own unresolved geometry; Direction owns visual character.
- Wide, intermediate, and compact preserve action, state, keyboard access, overflow ownership, and recovery.

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-VA-01` | The stated dominant task is the page's primary user outcome. | Candidate evidence. |
| `AR-VA-02` | Every required region and named relationship is present. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-VA-03` | Wide, intermediate, and compact use the declared topology transformations. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-VA-04` | Compact preserves every action, state, keyboard path, focus return, and recovery. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-VA-05` | The interactive template proves the prompt acceptance focus. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-VA-90` | live-operations-control-room | Reject. |
| `AR-VA-91` | timeline-status-monitor | Reject. |
| `AR-VA-92` | inventory-replenishment-planner | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `exchange-volatility-auction-reopening-console` only when codes 01–05 are evidenced and no 9* code holds. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unknown. Return `reject` for any rejection code. A difference limited to nouns, density, color, card count, component, or state is `duplicate-or-variation`.

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `volatility-reopening` | Owns the complete dominant task, version context, and descendant recovery. | Root of the required graph; a generic container cannot replace it. |
| `venue-instrument-session-rule-and-clock-version` | Owns this region's evidence, action, state, and recovery. | Follows semantic order and consumes the exact selected context; peer edges synchronize without merging owners. |
| `reference-price-and-dynamic-price-bands` | Owns this region's evidence, action, state, and recovery. | Follows semantic order and consumes the exact selected context; peer edges synchronize without merging owners. |
| `triggering-trade-or-quote-and-halt-reason` | Owns this region's evidence, action, state, and recovery. | Follows semantic order and consumes the exact selected context; peer edges synchronize without merging owners. |
| `auction-order-book` | Owns this region's evidence, action, state, and recovery. | Follows semantic order and consumes the exact selected context; peer edges synchronize without merging owners. |
| `price-time-side-quantity` | Owns this region's evidence, action, state, and recovery. | Follows semantic order and consumes the exact selected context; peer edges synchronize without merging owners. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous regions cannot preserve readable labels, exact associations, visible actions, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Trading-state clock, reference and bands, depth book, indicative clearing state, extension gates, and reopening receipt remain simultaneously visible.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while every required owner remains simultaneously usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only the current outcome or action may persist; it reserves space and yields to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `auction-order-book` Only the declared bounded region owns overflow; ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scroll.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority persistent region breaks the dominant relationship.
- **Topology response:** Indicative clearing state and the blocking gate remain primary; full depth, trigger evidence, and surveillance history move to synchronized disclosures while the price ladder owns bounded overflow.
- **Navigation replacement:** A named synchronized disclosure or drawer replaces each displaced region and exposes current state in its trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only the current outcome or action may persist; it reserves space and yields to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `auction-order-book` Only the declared bounded region owns overflow; ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scroll.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two simultaneous task owners cannot retain readable evidence and 44-by-44 CSS-pixel controls.
- **Topology response:** Halt reason and clock → reference and bands → price-level navigator → indicative clearing state → enter or cancel → extension → one uncross → residual and reopen receipt becomes a controlled sequence.
- **Navigation replacement:** One primary-pane sequence with explicit Previous and Next preserves selection, query, state, and scroll context.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only the current outcome or action may persist; it reserves space and yields to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `auction-order-book` Only the declared bounded region owns overflow; ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scroll.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `volatility-reopening → venue-instrument-session-rule-and-clock-version → reference-price-and-dynamic-price-bands → triggering-trade-or-quote-and-halt-reason → auction-order-book → price-time-side-quantity → indicative-match-price-executable-volume-and-imbalance → order-entry-cancel-freeze-and-extension-gates → uncross-allocation-and-residual-book → reopening-trade-and-price-band-reset → continuous-trading-state-and-surveillance-receipt`.
- Text zoom, long translation, and enlarged controls trigger the same named topology changes.
- CSS never reorders visual content away from keyboard or assistive-technology order.
- Long labels wrap and hidden detail has an explicit accessible reveal.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, edit, action, explanation, retry, and recovery remains reachable at intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve selected entity, version, pending state, validation result, and recovery point.
- Dynamic updates use a contextual status message without moving focus.
- Color, position, geometry, and motion have textual or structural equivalents.

## State obligations

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `venue-instrument-session-rule-and-clock-version` | Identify pending scope and preserve semantic position. |
| Ready | `reference-price-and-dynamic-price-bands` | Expose the complete dominant task and current version. |
| Empty / not applicable | `triggering-trade-or-quote-and-halt-reason` | Distinguish meaningful absence from unavailable evidence. |
| Error / retry | `auction-order-book` | Keep valid context and offer local retry without resetting selection. |
| Permission / unavailable | `price-time-side-quantity` | Do not imply restricted evidence is absent; provide a safe alternate route. |
| Pending | `indicative-match-price-executable-volume-and-imbalance` | Prevent duplicate action and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `order-entry-cancel-freeze-and-extension-gates` | Expose outcome, provenance, and the next valid action. |
| Stale / conflict | `uncross-allocation-and-residual-book` | Keep the last safe value and require explicit reconciliation. |
| Focus transition | `reopening-trade-and-price-band-reset` | Move focus only to a required error summary, then return it to the exact trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `continuous-trading-state-and-surveillance-receipt` | Preserve entity, query, state, and recovery when topology changes. |
| session preopen/continuous/halted/auction/reopened/closed | `venue-instrument-session-rule-and-clock-version` | Expose cause, consequence, and valid recovery without overwriting provenance. |
| band current/reset/stale | `reference-price-and-dynamic-price-bands` | Expose cause, consequence, and valid recovery without overwriting provenance. |
| trigger valid/cancelled | `triggering-trade-or-quote-and-halt-reason` | Expose cause, consequence, and valid recovery without overwriting provenance. |
| order accepted/rejected/cancelled/frozen | `auction-order-book` | Expose cause, consequence, and valid recovery without overwriting provenance. |

| uncross blocked/ready/executing/complete/failed | `uncross-allocation-and-residual-book` | Expose cause, consequence, and valid recovery without overwriting provenance. |
| allocation full/partial | `reopening-trade-and-price-band-reset` | Expose cause, consequence, and valid recovery without overwriting provenance. |
| residual resting/cancelled | `continuous-trading-state-and-surveillance-receipt` | Expose cause, consequence, and valid recovery without overwriting provenance. |
| surveillance clear/flagged | `continuous-trading-state-and-surveillance-receipt` | Expose cause, consequence, and valid recovery without overwriting provenance. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept only when the dominant task transforms required evidence into the declared outcome.
- Accept only when each required region has an independent owner and named relationships remain explicit.
- An instrument-specific state machine, dynamic price bands, price-time auction book, jointly derived indicative match and imbalance, timed extensions, one deterministic uncross, residual book, and explicit continuous-trading transition are present.

### Reject

- Reject `live-operations-control-room`; this is `AR-VA-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `timeline-status-monitor`; this is `AR-VA-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `inventory-replenishment-planner`; this is `AR-VA-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `generic market dashboard`; this is `AR-VA-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject any candidate that satisfies the task only by changing product nouns or visual treatment.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete graph, transformation contract, state and recovery parity, and acceptance focus all hold. Return `reject` for any rejection code. Return `needs-evidence` for an unresolved owner or relationship.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permissions, truthful state meaning, and permitted actions to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow realization, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, replace the dominant task, or weaken keyboard, focus, responsive, or recovery parity.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

External research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It supports task relationships, responsive transformation, interaction, and accessibility. It does not name StarCi owners, select exact geometry, create product facts, or authorize copying a source interface.

### Sources

| Source | What it supports | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| [Limit Up-Limit Down Plan](https://www.luldplan.com/) | Reference-price bands, limit states, pauses, and time-based extensions. | A venue's exact auction algorithm or copied interface. |
| [NYSE — Trading information](https://beta.nyse.com/trade/trading-information) | Venue trading-state, auction, order, and operational-rule context. | A universal allocation rule or product geometry. |
| [Carbon — Data table](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/) | Dense order-book records and explicit row states. | Exchange semantics or copied layout. |
| [W3C WAI — Status messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages) | Announcement of indicative, gate, and reopen changes without focus theft. | Market truth or exact topology. |
