# Regulated sample selection workbench

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | regulated-sample-selection-workbench |
| Family | work |
| Dominant task | Define a population and sampling method, generate a sample, assess coverage and bias, govern replacements, and lock an immutable testing handoff. |
| Search aliases | regulated-sample-selection-workbench; audit sample selection; representative sample; replacement governance |
| Authority | Dominant-task topology, region graph, responsive transformation, interaction parity, and state families. |

### Invariants

- Define a population and sampling method, generate a sample, assess coverage and bias, govern replacements, and lock an immutable testing handoff.
- Each required region has one semantic owner; supporting context never takes over the dominant task.
- DOM order, reading order, and focus order preserve meaning across wide, intermediate, and compact.
- Grammar supplies product facts; Principles resolve exact geometry; the archetype does not own visual direction.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| AR-RSS-01 | Define a population and sampling method, generate a sample, assess coverage and bias, govern replacements, and lock an immutable testing handoff. | required positive evidence |
| AR-RSS-02 | The critical region relationship and owner separation are evidenced. | required relationship evidence |
| AR-RSS-03 | The wide relationship fails, but compact preserves task, state, and recovery. | responsive transformation trigger |
| AR-RSS-04 | Error, permission, pending, success, and stale or conflict states have bounded recovery. | required state evidence |
| AR-RSS-90 | Reject query builders, experimental randomization design, control testing, and generic batch selection. | reject |
| AR-RSS-91 | The difference is only a product noun, density, color, component, state skin, or card count. | duplicate-or-variation |

### Selection rule

Return accept only when AR-RSS-01, AR-RSS-02, and AR-RSS-03 are evidenced, neither AR-RSS-90 nor AR-RSS-91 is present, and every required region remains necessary across all three topologies. Return needs-evidence when an owner, relation, or transformation is unresolved.

Critical relationship: Representativeness and replacement governance own the sample; testing receives only an immutable, coverage-assessed version.

### Region obligations

| Region ID | Owner | Required relationship |
|---|---|---|
| sample-selection | Owns the dominant-task boundary and contains every required region without inventing product semantics. | Contains population-frame-exclusions, method-parameters, generated-sample, coverage-bias-evidence, replacement-exception-log, locked-sample-version, testing-handoff while preserving each region's independent owner. |
| population-frame-exclusions | Owns membership, identity, status, and current selection for this bounded collection. | Receives context from sample-selection and gates method-parameters without merging authority. |
| method-parameters | Owns editable decision state, validation, and the pending guard for the named stage. | Receives context from population-frame-exclusions and gates generated-sample without merging authority. |
| generated-sample | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Receives context from method-parameters and gates coverage-bias-evidence without merging authority. |
| coverage-bias-evidence | Owns source evidence, provenance, freshness, and availability; it never decides the outcome. | Receives context from generated-sample and gates replacement-exception-log without merging authority. |
| replacement-exception-log | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Receives context from coverage-bias-evidence and gates locked-sample-version without merging authority. |
| locked-sample-version | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Receives context from replacement-exception-log and gates testing-handoff without merging authority. |
| testing-handoff | Owns the bounded outcome, receipt, or recovery route after every upstream gate passes. | Consumes verified state from locked-sample-version and emits the bounded outcome or recovery path. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- Topology response: Keep population and method, generated sample, coverage and bias evidence, and replacement log simultaneously visible.
- Failure trigger: simultaneous regions narrow readable measure, obscure state, or break the named relationship.
- Navigation replacement: none while regions remain simultaneous; sticky is limited to orientation context that fits.
- Sticky boundary: yield at short height and never obscure a focused control.
- Overflow owner: the page owns vertical overflow; only an intrinsic matrix owns bounded horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- Topology response: Make sample and coverage primary; move method parameters to a drawer.
- Failure trigger: supporting persistence competes with primary-task measure or focus.
- Navigation replacement: a named trigger opens the supporting dialog; Escape or Cancel closes it and focus returns to the exact trigger.
- Sticky boundary: persistent context yields at short height; the dialog body owns bounded vertical overflow.
- Overflow owner: the page retains vertical overflow; the supporting dialog owns only its internal overflow.

### Compact

- Topology response: Stage parameters, generated sample, coverage and bias, exceptions and replacements, immutable lock, then testing handoff.
- Failure trigger: the multi-pane relationship is no longer operable with 16px body text and 44px targets.
- Navigation replacement: Previous, Next, and a stage selector replace pane adjacency; Back preserves selection, draft, and recovery state.
- Sticky boundary: no fixed action bar; focused content remains visible.
- Overflow owner: no page-level horizontal scrolling; an intrinsic matrix becomes grouped records.

### Reflow

The region graph order is the DOM and reading order at every width. CSS does not reorder semantics. Text, localization, zoom, and spacing growth increase region height or trigger a topology change; content is not clipped. State survives movement into and out of the supporting pane.

### Interaction parity

Wide, intermediate, and compact expose the same action, selection, pending guard, success, error, retry, stale or conflict recovery, and outcome. Dynamic status is announced through a polite live region without stealing focus. A modal contains focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to its exact trigger.

## State obligations

Domain state catalog: frame loading/incomplete; exclusion valid/invalid; generation pending; sample selected; coverage sufficient/biased; replacement requested/approved; version unlocked/locked; handoff.

| State family | Obligation | Focus transition | Responsive presentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| initial/loading | Preserve known anatomy and name the waiting region. | Do not move focus automatically. | Keep the same stage identity. |
| ready | Show consistent fictional data and the current selection. | Focus remains at the activating control. | Preserve selection through transformation. |
| empty/not-applicable | Explain why content is empty and the valid next step. | Move to recovery only when continuation requires it. | Do not erase other required regions. |
| error/retry | Associate the error with its owner and provide bounded retry. | Multi-error focuses the summary; retry returns to the exact action. | Error is not color-only. |
| permission/unavailable | Preserve orientation and explain the limitation. | Do not focus a locked control. | Use the same reason in every topology. |
| pending | Prevent duplicates and preserve action meaning. | Do not steal focus for progress. | State stays with its action owner. |
| success | Confirm the outcome and a valid continuation. | Move focus only when it helps continuation. | Do not create a second source of truth. |
| stale/conflict | Name the changed version and preserve safe input. | Focus a contextual recovery choice. | Selection survives transformation. |
| domain states | Preserve the complete domain catalog: frame loading/incomplete; exclusion valid/invalid; generation pending; sample selected; coverage sufficient/biased; replacement requested/approved; version unlocked/locked; handoff. | Every modal returns focus to its trigger. | Preserve action and recovery parity. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

Accept when the dominant task needs this exact region graph, the critical relationship creates a distinct topology, and every responsive state preserves task and recovery parity.

### Reject

Reject query builders, experimental randomization design, control testing, and generic batch selection. Also reject duplicate-or-variation when the candidate only changes nouns, density, components, or visual state.

### Boundary verdict

The valid result is accept, reject, duplicate-or-variation, or needs-evidence under the Situation-code rule; visual preference is not evidence.

## Handoff

- Grammar receives real facts, semantic owners, permissions, states, and action consequences.
- Principles receives exact grid, measure, gaps, sizing, alignment, overflow, thresholds, sticky offsets, and focus accommodation.
- Direction receives visual character; the template is only one conforming realization.
