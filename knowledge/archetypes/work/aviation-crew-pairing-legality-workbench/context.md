### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `aviation-crew-pairing-legality-workbench` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Construct a legal set of multi-role aviation crew pairings that covers every flight leg while respecting base, qualification, positioning, connection, acclimatisation, flight-duty, rest and cumulative-duty constraints. |
| Search aliases | `aviation crew pairing legality`, `aviation crew pairing legality workspace`, `aviation crew pairing legality control` |
| Authority | Shared product-neutral macro topology; Grammar owns product semantics, Principles own unresolved geometry, and Direction owns visual character. |

### Invariants

- Construct a legal set of multi-role aviation crew pairings that covers every flight leg while respecting base, qualification, positioning, connection, acclimatisation, flight-duty, rest and cumulative-duty constraints.
- set coverage is invalid if any required leg-role is open, even when each individual duty is legal, and individual legality is invalid without feasible positioning.
- Every required region retains a separate owner and the same selected context.
- Wide, intermediate, and compact preserve meaningful DOM, reading, and focus order, action parity, and deterministic recovery.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-ACPLW-01` | The dominant task is the required observable outcome. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-ACPLW-02` | The complete required region graph and named relationships are necessary. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-ACPLW-03` | Compact preserves wide actions, state, recovery, and focus meaning. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-ACPLW-04` | Task-specific state can change after the user creates work state. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-ACPLW-90` | The dominant task is actually `driver-duty-rest-compliance-planner`. | Reject. |
| `AR-ACPLW-91` | The dominant task is actually `calendar-resource-scheduler`. | Reject. |
| `AR-ACPLW-92` | The dominant task is actually `dual-list-transfer`. | Reject. |
| `AR-ACPLW-93` | The dominant task is actually `critical-path-project-planner`. | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `aviation-crew-pairing-legality-workbench` if and only if `AR-ACPLW-01` through `AR-ACPLW-04` are evidenced and none of `AR-ACPLW-90` through `AR-ACPLW-93` holds. Return `needs-evidence` when an owner or relationship is unresolved; return `reject` when a rejection code holds.

|---|---|
| `crew-pairing` | Owns the dominant task, all descendant state, and the recovery boundary. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous regions can no longer retain readable labels, exact associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Flight-leg coverage network, eligible crew, candidate duty blocks, legality clocks, positioning, coverage matrix and selected pairings remain comparable; only the bounded leg-time axis owns horizontal overflow.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while every required region remains simultaneously usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current-task status or action may persist; it reserves space and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `schedule-rule-version-bases-and-planning-horizon` owns bounded overflow; the page owns no horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority supporting region makes the primary relationship unusable.
- **Topology response:** Selected uncovered leg and candidate duty stay pinned; coverage/qualification and clock/positioning evidence alternate while set-level completeness persists.
- **Navigation replacement:** Named evidence views replace displaced regions and preserve exact selection and trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** The current verdict persists only while its target remains visible and returns to flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The wide bounded owner remains local; alternate evidence views create no nested page scroll.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two task regions cannot simultaneously preserve readable evidence, 44-pixel targets, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Uncovered flight-leg role → eligible named crew by role/qualification/base → proposed multi-leg duty → that person's acclimatisation and duty/rest clocks → deadhead/positioning connection → individual legality → add pairing to set → recompute every remaining or double-covered role → complete set proof → handoff; an ordered duty proof replaces the network.
- **Navigation replacement:** A primary-pane sequence with Back restores selection, state, query, scroll context, and the exact trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** The action bar reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The bounded visual has a textual ordered equivalent as the primary compact representation.

### Reflow

- Semantic, DOM, and meaningful focus order preserve the graph: `crew-pairing → schedule-rule-version-bases-and-planning-horizon → every-flight-leg-by-required-captain-first-officer-and-cabin-role-slot → individual-crew-base-qualification-recency-and-availability → candidate-multi-leg-duty-and-pairing-builder → per-person-flight-duty-rest-acclimatisation-and-timezone-clocks → deadhead-positioning-and-connection-feasibility-per-person → pairing-cost-robustness-and-set-level-role-coverage-matrix → selected-pairing-set-with-no-uncovered-or-double-owned-role → every-member-legality-proof → roster-handoff`.
- Long labels, translation, zoom, and enlarged controls trigger the same named topology changes.
- CSS never reorders semantics; ordinary content creates no page-level horizontal scroll.
- Hidden detail always has an explicit accessible reveal path.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, edit, action, explanation, retry, and recovery remains reachable at intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact selected object, order, data state, pending result, and error context.
- Pointer actions have keyboard and single-pointer non-drag equivalents when movement is involved.
- Dynamic updates announce one contextual status without stealing focus; color is never the only signal.
- A modal receives and contains focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.

## State obligations

Task-specific states: Schedule loading/versioned, leg-role uncovered/covered/overcovered, crew available/unavailable, qualification current/expired/missing, duty draft/legal/illegal, acclimatisation known/unknown/changed, flight-duty clock available/warning/exceeded, rest qualifying/insufficient, positioning confirmed/missed, pairing selected/rejected, coverage set incomplete/complete and roster handoff pending/accepted/returned.

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `schedule-rule-version-bases-and-planning-horizon` | Name the loading scope, reserve the primary region, and block only the failed owner. |
| Ready | `every-flight-leg-by-required-captain-first-officer-and-cabin-role-slot` | Expose the current object, owner relationship, selection, and valid action in text and semantics. |
| Empty / not applicable | `every-flight-leg-by-required-captain-first-officer-and-cabin-role-slot` | Distinguish true empty, no-match, and non-applicable states and provide the valid next action. |
| Error / retry | `every-member-legality-proof` | Keep valid context and input, name the failed owner, and provide local retry. |
| Permission / unavailable | `roster-handoff` | Explain the restriction without implying hidden evidence is absent and provide a safe exit. |
| Pending | `roster-handoff` | Prevent duplicate action, retain the exact target, and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `roster-handoff` | Confirm the exact outcome, preserve selection, and provide the next valid action or recovery. |
| Stale / conflict | `schedule-rule-version-bases-and-planning-horizon` | Keep the last safe value, identify the version or time conflict, and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `roster-handoff` | Move focus only to a modal or required error summary, then return it to the exact trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `crew-pairing` | Preserve state, selection, query, pending result, and recovery when topology changes. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when the dominant task is: Construct a legal set of multi-role aviation crew pairings that covers every flight leg while respecting base, qualification, positioning, connection, acclimatisation, flight-duty, rest and cumulative-duty constraints.
- Accept when every required region and relationship in the graph is necessary to complete the task.
- Accept when compact preserves task, state, and recovery through a replacement topology instead of stacking desktop boxes.

### Reject

- Reject `driver-duty-rest-compliance-planner`; this is `AR-ACPLW-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `calendar-resource-scheduler`; this is `AR-ACPLW-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `dual-list-transfer`; this is `AR-ACPLW-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `critical-path-project-planner`; this is `AR-ACPLW-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete graph, and compact parity all hold. Differences limited to noun, density, color, component, card count, or state are `duplicate-or-variation`.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permitted actions, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.
