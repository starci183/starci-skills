## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `process-mass-balance-analyzer` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Reconcile conserved material through a network of unit operations, streams, and recycle loops and locate imbalance and uncertainty. |
| Search aliases | `mass balance`, `process streams`, `conservation network`, `recycle reconciliation` |
| Authority | Shared, product-neutral macro topology. |

### Invariants

- Every unit operation and the whole recirculating network own conservation equations; stream quantities connect local and global balances.
- The required region graph remains `mass-balance-analyzer → process-and-case-context → unit-operation-flow-graph → stream-composition-ledger → local-and-global-conservation-equations → imbalance-priority → selected-unit-or-stream-detail → uncertainty-and-reconciliation → export`.
- DOM order, reading order, and meaningful focus order remain identical.
- Grammar owns product meaning; Principles own unresolved geometry; Direction owns visual character.
- Loading, ready, empty, error, unavailable, pending, success, and stale or conflict states preserve the dominant task.
- Edges must carry conserved quantities through a recirculating network and reconcile local with global equations.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-PM-01` | The dominant task is: Reconcile conserved material through a network of unit operations, streams, and recycle loops and locate imbalance and uncertainty. | Candidate evidence. |
| `AR-PM-02` | The complete required region graph is semantically present. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-PM-03` | Compact preserves the wide selection, action, state, and recovery. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-PM-04` | Edges must carry conserved quantities through a recirculating network and reconcile local with global equations. | Required relationship evidence. |
| `AR-PM-90` | The dominant task is dependency health graph. | Reject. |
| `AR-PM-91` | The dominant task is one bridge waterfall. | Reject. |
| `AR-PM-92` | The dominant task is quota editor. | Reject. |
| `AR-PM-93` | The dominant task is scenario modeler. | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `process-mass-balance-analyzer` only when `AR-PM-01`, `AR-PM-02`, `AR-PM-03`, and `AR-PM-04` are evidenced and none of the `AR-PM-90` through `AR-PM-93` rejection codes holds. Return `needs-evidence` when one required owner or relationship is unknown. Return `reject` when any rejection code holds.

## Region graph

```text
mass-balance-analyzer
└─ process-and-case-context
   └─ unit-operation-flow-graph
      └─ stream-composition-ledger
         └─ local-and-global-conservation-equations
            └─ imbalance-priority
               └─ selected-unit-or-stream-detail
                  └─ uncertainty-and-reconciliation
                     └─ export
```

- Required relationship: Every unit operation and the whole recirculating network own conservation equations; stream quantities connect local and global balances.

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `mass-balance-analyzer` | Owns the page-level dominant task and all descendant state. | Root of the graph. |
| `process-and-case-context` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for process and case context without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `mass-balance-analyzer` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `unit-operation-flow-graph` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for unit operation flow graph without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `process-and-case-context` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `stream-composition-ledger` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for stream composition ledger without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `unit-operation-flow-graph` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `local-and-global-conservation-equations` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for local and global conservation equations without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `stream-composition-ledger` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `imbalance-priority` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for imbalance priority without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `local-and-global-conservation-equations` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `selected-unit-or-stream-detail` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for selected unit or stream detail without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `imbalance-priority` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `uncertainty-and-reconciliation` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for uncertainty and reconciliation without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `selected-unit-or-stream-detail` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |
| `export` | Owns the evidence, state, and action for export without borrowing product semantics. | Follows `uncertainty-and-reconciliation` in semantic order and retains the same selection context. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous evidence owners cannot retain readable labels, exact cross-region associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Keep the flow graph, stream ledger, and balance equations visible.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while every simultaneous owner remains usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only the active cross-region action may persist; it reserves space and yields when short height cannot keep focus visible.
- **Overflow owner:** `unit-operation-flow-graph` alone may own bounded two-dimensional overflow when its task meaning requires it.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority persistent region makes the dominant relationship unreadable or inoperable.
- **Topology response:** Make the graph supporting; prioritize the imbalance list and ledger with an active-path summary.
- **Navigation replacement:** A named pane control exposes the displaced region with the current selection and state intact.
- **Sticky boundary:** A persistent action remains only while its target and status are visible; it returns to flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `unit-operation-flow-graph` retains its bounded overflow; displaced prose and controls reflow.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two simultaneous task regions cannot preserve readable evidence and 44-by-44 CSS-pixel controls.
- **Topology response:** Use imbalance-first list → selected unit path → inputs or outputs → equation → uncertainty or reconcile; the graph is optional.
- **Navigation replacement:** Explicit Previous, Next, and named-pane controls restore selection, state, and scroll context.
- **Sticky boundary:** The compact step control reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `unit-operation-flow-graph` remains the only bounded exception; all other content uses page scrolling.

### Reflow

- Semantic and DOM order is `mass-balance-analyzer → process-and-case-context → unit-operation-flow-graph → stream-composition-ledger → local-and-global-conservation-equations → imbalance-priority → selected-unit-or-stream-detail → uncertainty-and-reconciliation → export`.
- Text zoom, long translation, and enlarged controls trigger the same relationship-driven topology changes.
- CSS never reorders the visual sequence away from keyboard or assistive-technology order.
- Long labels wrap and every hidden region has a named accessible reveal path.
- Ordinary content never creates page-level horizontal scrolling.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, measurement, action, retry, and recovery path remains reachable in intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact selected item, shared coordinate or path, data state, and pending or completed receipt.
- Dynamic updates announce one contextual status without stealing focus.
- A modal traps focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.
- Color, position, geometry, and visual marks have textual or tabular equivalents.
- The fictional network remains imbalanced until the recycle stream converges.

## State obligations

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `process-and-case-context` | Identify the pending owner and preserve its semantic position. |
| Ready | `unit-operation-flow-graph` | Expose the complete dominant task and synchronized evidence. |
| Empty / not applicable | `stream-composition-ledger` | Distinguish meaningful absence from unavailable evidence. |
| Error / retry | `local-and-global-conservation-equations` | Keep valid context and offer a local retry without resetting selection. |
| Permission / unavailable | `imbalance-priority` | Do not imply hidden evidence is absent; provide a safe alternate route. |
| Pending | `export` | Prevent duplicate action and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `export` | Expose the result, preserve context, and provide the next valid action. |
| Stale / conflict | `process-and-case-context` | Keep the last safe value and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `export` | Move focus only for a modal or error summary, then return it to the trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `mass-balance-analyzer` | Preserve selection, state, and recovery when topology changes. |

Applicable state family: stream loading, stream missing, unit balanced, unit imbalanced, recycle convergence pending, recycle convergence failure, composition invalid, uncertainty high, reconciliation proposed, reconciliation accepted, export ready.

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when reconcile conserved material through a network of unit operations, streams, and recycle loops and locate imbalance and uncertainty.
- Accept when every unit operation and the whole recirculating network own conservation equations; stream quantities connect local and global balances.
- Accept when compact preserves the exact task evidence, action, and recovery.

### Reject

- Reject dependency health graph; this is `AR-PM-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject one bridge waterfall; this is `AR-PM-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject quota editor; this is `AR-PM-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject scenario modeler; this is `AR-PM-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject a candidate whose only difference is product noun, count, density, color, component, or state as `duplicate-or-variation`.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete region graph, mandatory owner relationship, and compact interaction parity all hold. Return `reject` for any rejection code. Return `needs-evidence` when a required owner or relationship is unresolved.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permissions, actions, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow realization, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

External research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It supports task relationships, adaptive behavior, and accessibility obligations; it does not name StarCi owners, select exact geometry, or grant permission to copy a source interface. The sources were opened and verified as current official pages during this batch.
