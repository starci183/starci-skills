# Fund NAV strike workbench

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `fund-nav-strike-workbench` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Produce one official fund NAV at a declared valuation point by resolving position, price, foreign-exchange, corporate-action, accrual, and share-class exceptions before per-unit prices are released. |
| Search aliases | fund valuation point, NAV exception queue, share-class strike |
| Authority | Product-neutral page-topology authority; it does not choose product semantics, visual direction, tokens, components, exact geometry, or breakpoints. |

### Invariants

- `nav-strike` owns the complete dominant task and recovery boundary.
- Every unresolved exception blocks the fund strike and propagates through total net assets into affected classes; release follows the tolerance gate, and correction creates new lineage.
- Every required region retains its named owner.
- Wide, intermediate, and compact change topology when a named relationship fails, never by device label.
- Transformation preserves selection, draft input, pending work, recovery, reading order, and focus meaning.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Observable situation | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-FNS-01` | Produce one official fund NAV at a declared valuation point by resolving position, price, foreign-exchange, corporate-action, accrual, and share-class exceptions before per-unit prices are released. | Required positive evidence. |
| `AR-FNS-02` | Every required region and relationship is necessary for completion. | Require the complete graph. |
| `AR-FNS-03` | The named wide, intermediate, and compact transformations preserve the same work state. | Require responsive parity. |
| `AR-FNS-04` | Failure, pending, conflict, permission, or recovery can occur after state exists. | Retain state and focus meaning. |
| `AR-FNS-90` | An adjacent archetype owns the work object or completion event more precisely. | Reject. |
| `AR-FNS-91` | Reject calculation-estimate-flow, spreadsheet-grid-editor, review-submit-ledger, or reconciliation-diff-workbench when valuation-point lock, strike-blocking exceptions, multi-class propagation, accruals, class share counts, and correction-by-new-strike lineage are absent. | Reject. |
| `AR-FNS-92` | The candidate differs only by noun, density, color, component, card count, or state variation. | Reject as `duplicate-or-variation`. |

### Selection rule

Select `fund-nav-strike-workbench` if and only if `AR-FNS-01` through `04` are evidenced, all required regions and relationships are present, and none of `AR-FNS-90` through `92` is present. Return `needs-evidence` when dominant task, owner relationship, overflow owner, or completion consequence is unproved. Return `reject` when a rejection code is present.

## Region graph

```text
nav-strike
  ├─ fund-share-class-valuation-point-and-policy-version
  ├─ position-and-cash-ledger
  ├─ market-price-fair-value-and-fx-source-lineage
  ├─ corporate-action-income-expense-and-liability-accruals
  ├─ strike-blocking-exception-queue
  ├─ fund-total-net-assets
  ├─ allocation-across-multiple-share-classes-and-share-counts
  ├─ per-class-nav-values
  ├─ reasonableness-review-and-tolerance-gate
  ├─ official-strike-distribution
  └─ correction-as-new-strike-lineage
```

Every unresolved exception blocks the fund strike and propagates through total net assets into affected classes; release follows the tolerance gate, and correction creates new lineage.

### Region obligations

| Region | Owner and relationship obligation |
|---|---|
| `nav-strike` | Owns the complete valuation, exception, class allocation, release, and correction task. |
| `fund-share-class-valuation-point-and-policy-version` | Binds every input and decision to one fund scope, valuation point, and policy version. |
| `position-and-cash-ledger` | Owns reconciled positions, cash, and quantities. |
| `market-price-fair-value-and-fx-source-lineage` | Owns pricing, fair-value, FX sources, and overrides with lineage. |
| `corporate-action-income-expense-and-liability-accruals` | Owns non-price adjustments into net assets. |
| `strike-blocking-exception-queue` | Owns every unresolved issue that blocks the whole strike. |
| `fund-total-net-assets` | Aggregates resolved assets and liabilities at the valuation point. |
| `allocation-across-multiple-share-classes-and-share-counts` | Allocates common and class-specific amounts without losing conservation. |
| `per-class-nav-values` | Derives each class per-unit value from allocated net assets and share count. |
| `reasonableness-review-and-tolerance-gate` | Blocks release when a declared tolerance fails. |
| `official-strike-distribution` | Owns released values and distribution acknowledgements. |
| `correction-as-new-strike-lineage` | Preserves corrections as new strikes beside immutable prior releases. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Simultaneous comparison no longer leaves enough measure for profiles, evidence, controls, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Holdings valuation, exception queue, source evidence, accruals, class allocation, tolerance gate, and strike receipt remain visible together.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while direct region access remains operable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current scope or the primary receipt may persist after reserving space.
- **Overflow owner:** One intrinsically tabular or graph region may own bounded overflow; the page owns no horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** The lowest-priority supporting region can no longer coexist without compressing the dominant relationship.
- **Topology response:** Blocking exceptions and provisional strike remain primary; full holdings, source lineage, and prior-strike comparison move to synchronized drawers.
- **Navigation replacement:** A labeled contextual drawer opens the exact supporting region and preserves selection, draft, scroll, and return-focus target.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current scope or the primary receipt may persist; short height returns it to normal flow.
- **Overflow owner:** The same bounded evidence region remains the sole overflow owner.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Peer regions can no longer remain simultaneously readable and operable.
- **Topology response:** Valuation point → highest-impact exception → selected holding/source → resolve or override → class expense/share allocation → provisional NAV → tolerance gate → release or correct; holdings become an exception-first queue.
- **Navigation replacement:** A labeled stage navigator exposes one primary pane at a time and returns focus to the entered stage heading.
- **Sticky boundary:** The relationship receipt may persist only with reserved space and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** A numeric table becomes a labeled route or remains one bounded navigator; the page never scrolls horizontally.

### Reflow

- DOM order, reading order, and meaningful focus order follow `nav-strike → fund-share-class-valuation-point-and-policy-version → position-and-cash-ledger → market-price-fair-value-and-fx-source-lineage → corporate-action-income-expense-and-liability-accruals → strike-blocking-exception-queue → fund-total-net-assets → allocation-across-multiple-share-classes-and-share-counts → per-class-nav-values → reasonableness-review-and-tolerance-gate → official-strike-distribution → correction-as-new-strike-lineage`.
- CSS never reorders semantic content.
- Long labels, translation, enlarged text, and zoom wrap without losing actions or state.
- A modal drawer focuses its heading, contains modal focus, supports Escape and Cancel, and returns to the exact trigger.

### Interaction parity

- Pointer, keyboard, and assistive technology reach every core action.
- Drag or gesture has an add, remove, or ordered-list alternative.
- A topology change retains selection, completed steps, pending guards, errors, and recovery.
- Dynamic status uses text and semantics in addition to color and announces without stealing focus.
- Multi-error validation retains input and moves focus to a summary.
- Task parity includes positions loading/reconciled; price current/stale/missing/overridden; fair-value review pending/approved; FX current/stale; corporate action pending/booked; accrual estimated/final; exception open/waived/resolved and blocking/released; fund NAV provisional/held; class values pending/recalculated/final; strike provisional/released/superseded-by-correction; tolerance pass/fail; distribution pending/acknowledged.

## State obligations

Task-specific states: positions loading/reconciled; price current/stale/missing/overridden; fair-value review pending/approved; FX current/stale; corporate action pending/booked; accrual estimated/final; exception open/waived/resolved and blocking/released; fund NAV provisional/held; class values pending/recalculated/final; strike provisional/released/superseded-by-correction; tolerance pass/fail; distribution pending/acknowledged.

| State family | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Initial / loading | Name the loading scope, reserve the primary region, and block only the failed region. |
| Ready | Expose the current object, owner relationship, evidence state, and valid actions in text. |
| Empty / not-applicable | Distinguish true empty, no-match, excluded, and non-applicable states with a next action. |
| Error / retry | Name the failed scope, retain input and work state, and provide a focused retry or correction target. |
| Permission / unavailable | Explain the restriction; read-only differs from disabled and retains context. |
| Pending | Prevent duplicate action, retain context, allow safe cancellation, and announce progress. |
| Success | Confirm the exact changed scope and update dependent receipts. |
| Stale / conflict | Compare versions, never overwrite silently, and retain deterministic recovery. |
| Focus transition | User-triggered stage changes focus the new heading; status-only updates do not move focus; modal close returns to the trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | Wide retains simultaneity; intermediate makes lower-priority support temporary; compact uses one primary stage with parity. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Load holdings, surface stale and missing price lineage, approve a fair-value override, book accruals, allocate across multiple classes, pass tolerance, and issue a versioned strike.
- Accept a variation only when dominant task, required regions, relationships, transformations, and completion event remain unchanged.

### Reject

- Reject calculation-estimate-flow, spreadsheet-grid-editor, review-submit-ledger, or reconciliation-diff-workbench when valuation-point lock, strike-blocking exceptions, multi-class propagation, accruals, class share counts, and correction-by-new-strike lineage are absent.
- Reject when an adjacent archetype owns the work object or completion event more precisely.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the selection rule passes. Return `reject` for `AR-FNS-90`, `91`, or `92`. Return `needs-evidence` when business truth does not prove dominant task, owner relationship, overflow owner, or completion consequence.

## Handoff

1. Business truth supplies actors, objects, rules, permissions, state transitions, and completion consequences.
2. This archetype resolves dominant task, region graph, responsive replacement, semantic order, and parity.
3. Grammar binds product-semantic owners without changing topology.
4. Principles resolve exact grid, measure, gap, size, alignment, overflow, and content-fit breakpoints.
5. Direction expresses visual character inside accepted owners.

## Non-binding research evidence

### Evidence boundary

Research is advisory evidence, not product truth. It does not authorize copying geometry, component trees, product nouns, breakpoints, or visual treatment. Binding product claims still route through business truth, Grammar, and Principles.
