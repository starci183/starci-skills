# Taxonomy facet modeling workbench

## LOADS

None.

## Record

### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | taxonomy-facet-modeling-workbench |
| Family | work |
| Dominant task | Author a controlled concept scheme with preferred and alternate labels, semantic relations, and facet behavior, then validate consuming search behavior. |
| Search aliases | taxonomy-facet-modeling-workbench; taxonomy editor; concept scheme; facet modeling |
| Authority | Dominant-task topology, region graph, responsive transformation, interaction parity, and state families. |

### Invariants

- Author a controlled concept scheme with preferred and alternate labels, semantic relations, and facet behavior, then validate consuming search behavior.
- Each required region has one semantic owner; supporting context never takes over the dominant task.
- DOM order, reading order, and focus order preserve meaning across wide, intermediate, and compact.
- Grammar supplies product facts; Principles resolve exact geometry; the archetype does not own visual direction.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| AR-TFM-01 | Author a controlled concept scheme with preferred and alternate labels, semantic relations, and facet behavior, then validate consuming search behavior. | required positive evidence |
| AR-TFM-02 | The critical region relationship and owner separation are evidenced. | required relationship evidence |
| AR-TFM-03 | The wide relationship fails, but compact preserves task, state, and recovery. | responsive transformation trigger |
| AR-TFM-04 | Error, permission, pending, success, and stale or conflict states have bounded recovery. | required state evidence |
| AR-TFM-90 | Reject knowledge-graph exploration, document outlines, cross-framework mapping, and generic rule building. | reject |
| AR-TFM-91 | The difference is only a product noun, density, color, component, state skin, or card count. | duplicate-or-variation |

### Selection rule

Return accept only when AR-TFM-01, AR-TFM-02, and AR-TFM-03 are evidenced, neither AR-TFM-90 nor AR-TFM-91 is present, and every required region remains necessary across all three topologies. Return needs-evidence when an owner, relation, or transformation is unresolved.

Critical relationship: Hierarchy, semantic relations, and facet behavior are separate owners; validation must detect label and cycle conflicts before publish.

### Region obligations

| Region ID | Owner | Required relationship |
|---|---|---|
| taxonomy-workbench | Owns the dominant-task boundary and contains every required region without inventing product semantics. | Contains concept-scheme-tree, selected-concept-label-definition, broader-narrower-related-graph, facet-rule-preview, validation-issues, publish-version while preserving each region's independent owner. |
| concept-scheme-tree | Owns membership, identity, status, and current selection for this bounded collection. | Receives context from taxonomy-workbench and gates selected-concept-label-definition without merging authority. |
| selected-concept-label-definition | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Receives context from concept-scheme-tree and gates broader-narrower-related-graph without merging authority. |
| broader-narrower-related-graph | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Receives context from selected-concept-label-definition and gates facet-rule-preview without merging authority. |
| facet-rule-preview | Owns a derived interpretation or consequence preview; it never becomes a second input authority. | Receives context from broader-narrower-related-graph and gates validation-issues without merging authority. |
| validation-issues | Owns the state and obligation of the named stage; it does not take authority from adjacent regions. | Receives context from facet-rule-preview and gates publish-version without merging authority. |
| publish-version | Owns the bounded outcome, receipt, or recovery route after every upstream gate passes. | Consumes verified state from validation-issues and emits the bounded outcome or recovery path. |

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- Topology response: Keep concept tree, selected concept editor, relation graph, facet preview, and validation simultaneously visible.
- Failure trigger: simultaneous regions narrow readable measure, obscure state, or break the named relationship.
- Navigation replacement: none while regions remain simultaneous; sticky is limited to orientation context that fits.
- Sticky boundary: yield at short height and never obscure a focused control.
- Overflow owner: the page owns vertical overflow; only an intrinsic matrix owns bounded horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- Topology response: Keep the selected concept path persistent; alternate relation and facet preview as named panes.
- Failure trigger: supporting persistence competes with primary-task measure or focus.
- Navigation replacement: a named trigger opens the supporting dialog; Escape or Cancel closes it and focus returns to the exact trigger.
- Sticky boundary: persistent context yields at short height; the dialog body owns bounded vertical overflow.
- Overflow owner: the page retains vertical overflow; the supporting dialog owns only its internal overflow.

### Compact

- Topology response: Stage concept path selection, concept editing, relations, facet preview, validation, then version publish.
- Failure trigger: the multi-pane relationship is no longer operable with 16px body text and 44px targets.
- Navigation replacement: Previous, Next, and a stage selector replace pane adjacency; Back preserves selection, draft, and recovery state.
- Sticky boundary: no fixed action bar; focused content remains visible.
- Overflow owner: no page-level horizontal scrolling; an intrinsic matrix becomes grouped records.

### Reflow

The region graph order is the DOM and reading order at every width. CSS does not reorder semantics. Text, localization, zoom, and spacing growth increase region height or trigger a topology change; content is not clipped. State survives movement into and out of the supporting pane.

### Interaction parity

Wide, intermediate, and compact expose the same action, selection, pending guard, success, error, retry, stale or conflict recovery, and outcome. Dynamic status is announced through a polite live region without stealing focus. A modal contains focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to its exact trigger.

## State obligations

Domain state catalog: scheme loading; concept draft/deprecated; label duplicate/missing; relation valid/cyclic; facet preview empty/conflicting; validation pass/fail; publish pending; version conflict.

| State family | Obligation | Focus transition | Responsive presentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| initial/loading | Preserve known anatomy and name the waiting region. | Do not move focus automatically. | Keep the same stage identity. |
| ready | Show consistent fictional data and the current selection. | Focus remains at the activating control. | Preserve selection through transformation. |
| empty/not-applicable | Explain why content is empty and the valid next step. | Move to recovery only when continuation requires it. | Do not erase other required regions. |
| error/retry | Associate the error with its owner and provide bounded retry. | Multi-error focuses the summary; retry returns to the exact action. | Error is not color-only. |
| permission/unavailable | Preserve orientation and explain the limitation. | Do not focus a locked control. | Use the same reason in every topology. |
| pending | Prevent duplicates and preserve action meaning. | Do not steal focus for progress. | State stays with its action owner. |
| success | Confirm the outcome and a valid continuation. | Move focus only when it helps continuation. | Do not create a second source of truth. |
| stale/conflict | Name the changed version and preserve safe input. | Focus a contextual recovery choice. | Selection survives transformation. |
| domain states | Preserve the complete domain catalog: scheme loading; concept draft/deprecated; label duplicate/missing; relation valid/cyclic; facet preview empty/conflicting; validation pass/fail; publish pending; version conflict. | Every modal returns focus to its trigger. | Preserve action and recovery parity. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

Accept when the dominant task needs this exact region graph, the critical relationship creates a distinct topology, and every responsive state preserves task and recovery parity.

### Reject

Reject knowledge-graph exploration, document outlines, cross-framework mapping, and generic rule building. Also reject duplicate-or-variation when the candidate only changes nouns, density, components, or visual state.

### Boundary verdict

The valid result is accept, reject, duplicate-or-variation, or needs-evidence under the Situation-code rule; visual preference is not evidence.

## Handoff

- Grammar receives real facts, semantic owners, permissions, states, and action consequences.
- Principles receives exact grid, measure, gaps, sizing, alignment, overflow, thresholds, sticky offsets, and focus accommodation.
- Direction receives visual character; the template is only one conforming realization.
