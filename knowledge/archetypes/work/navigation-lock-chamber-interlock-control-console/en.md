### Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archetype ID | `navigation-lock-chamber-interlock-control-console` |
| Family | Work |
| Dominant task | Transit one selected vessel group between unequal water levels by controlling a navigation lock's chamber, gates and filling or emptying valves, permitting each movement only after occupancy, mooring, hydraulic-head and equipment interlocks prove it safe. |
| Search aliases | `navigation lock chamber interlock control`, `navigation lock chamber interlock workspace`, `lock chamber interlock control control` |
| Authority | Shared product-neutral macro topology; Grammar owns product semantics, Principles own unresolved geometry, and Direction owns visual character. |

### Invariants

- Transit one selected vessel group between unequal water levels by controlling a navigation lock's chamber, gates and filling or emptying valves, permitting each movement only after occupancy, mooring, hydraulic-head and equipment interlocks prove it safe.
- no vessel movement or gate opening exists outside the physical water-level state and mutually exclusive gate/valve interlocks.
- Every required region retains a separate owner and the same selected context.
- Wide, intermediate, and compact preserve meaningful DOM, reading, and focus order, action parity, and deterministic recovery.

## Recognition

### Situation codes

| Code | Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AR-NLCICC-01` | The dominant task is the required observable outcome. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-NLCICC-02` | The complete required region graph and named relationships are necessary. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-NLCICC-03` | Compact preserves wide actions, state, recovery, and focus meaning. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-NLCICC-04` | Task-specific state can change after the user creates work state. | Required evidence. |
| `AR-NLCICC-90` | The dominant task is actually `guided-setup-checklist`. | Reject. |
| `AR-NLCICC-91` | The dominant task is actually `workflow-automation-builder`. | Reject. |
| `AR-NLCICC-92` | The dominant task is actually `railway-movement-authority-control-console`. | Reject. |
| `AR-NLCICC-93` | The dominant task is actually `reservoir-release-rule-curve-coordinator`. | Reject. |

### Selection rule

Select `navigation-lock-chamber-interlock-control-console` if and only if `AR-NLCICC-01` through `AR-NLCICC-04` are evidenced and none of `AR-NLCICC-90` through `AR-NLCICC-93` holds. Return `needs-evidence` when an owner or relationship is unresolved; return `reject` when a rejection code holds.

## Responsive contract

### Wide

- **Failure trigger:** Wide ends when simultaneous regions can no longer retain readable labels, exact associations, and complete actions.
- **Topology response:** Lock section, selected vessel group, chamber occupancy/mooring, all water levels, gate/valve interlock matrix, active hydraulic step and movement command remain visible as one control surface.
- **Navigation replacement:** None while every required region remains simultaneously usable.
- **Sticky boundary:** Only current-task status or action may persist; it reserves space and yields at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** `upper-lower-gate-and-filling-emptying-valve-interlock-matrix` owns bounded overflow; the page owns no horizontal overflow.

### Intermediate

- **Failure trigger:** Intermediate begins when the lowest-priority supporting region makes the primary relationship unusable.
- **Topology response:** Chamber occupancy, head differential and the single eligible command stay pinned; physical section and detailed equipment/interlock evidence alternate while the issued movement authority persists to acknowledgement.
- **Navigation replacement:** Named evidence views replace displaced regions and preserve exact selection and trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** The current verdict persists only while its target remains visible and returns to flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The wide bounded owner remains local; alternate evidence views create no nested page scroll.

### Compact

- **Failure trigger:** Compact begins when two task regions cannot simultaneously preserve readable evidence, 44-pixel targets, and unobscured focus.
- **Topology response:** Vessel group and direction → chamber occupancy/mooring → upstream/downstream/chamber levels → upper/lower gate and fill/empty valve states → only eligible hydraulic command → head equalization proof → only eligible gate/movement command → chamber-clear reset and cycle receipt; a semantic equipment-state sequence replaces the lock diagram without horizontal page scroll.
- **Navigation replacement:** A primary-pane sequence with Back restores selection, state, query, scroll context, and the exact trigger.
- **Sticky boundary:** The action bar reserves content space, never obscures focus, and yields to normal flow at short height.
- **Overflow owner:** The bounded visual has a textual ordered equivalent as the primary compact representation.

### Reflow

- Semantic, DOM, and meaningful focus order preserve the graph: `navigation-lock-control → lockage-direction-operating-authority-and-equipment-version → selected-vessel-group-dimensions-and-approach-clearance → chamber-occupancy-and-secure-mooring-proof → upstream-downstream-and-chamber-water-levels → upper-lower-gate-and-filling-emptying-valve-interlock-matrix → eligible-fill-or-empty-command → hydraulic-head-equalization-and-gate-load-verification → eligible-gate-open-command → vessel-enter-or-exit-movement-authority → chamber-clear-equipment-reset-and-water-use-receipt → completed-held-or-aborted-cycle-lineage`.
- Long labels, translation, zoom, and enlarged controls trigger the same named topology changes.
- CSS never reorders semantics; ordinary content creates no page-level horizontal scroll.
- Hidden detail always has an explicit accessible reveal path.

### Interaction parity

- Every wide selection, edit, action, explanation, retry, and recovery remains reachable at intermediate and compact.
- Topology changes preserve the exact selected object, order, data state, pending result, and error context.
- Pointer actions have keyboard and single-pointer non-drag equivalents when movement is involved.
- Dynamic updates announce one contextual status without stealing focus; color is never the only signal.
- A modal receives and contains focus, supports Escape or Cancel, and returns focus to the exact trigger.

## State obligations

Task-specific states: Vessel group waiting/entering/moored/exiting/clear, chamber empty/occupied/unknown, mooring unconfirmed/secure/released, water-level sensor live/stale/disagreeing, head differential unsafe/equalizing/equalized, upper/lower gate open/closed/moving/faulted, fill/empty valve open/closed/moving/faulted, interlock satisfied/blocked/bypassed-with-authority, command proposed/issued/acknowledged/failed, cycle active/held/aborted/complete and equipment reset pending/verified.

| State | Owning region | Obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial / loading | `lockage-direction-operating-authority-and-equipment-version` | Name the loading scope, reserve the primary region, and block only the failed owner. |
| Ready | `selected-vessel-group-dimensions-and-approach-clearance` | Expose the current object, owner relationship, selection, and valid action in text and semantics. |
| Empty / not applicable | `selected-vessel-group-dimensions-and-approach-clearance` | Distinguish true empty, no-match, and non-applicable states and provide the valid next action. |
| Error / retry | `chamber-clear-equipment-reset-and-water-use-receipt` | Keep valid context and input, name the failed owner, and provide local retry. |
| Permission / unavailable | `completed-held-or-aborted-cycle-lineage` | Explain the restriction without implying hidden evidence is absent and provide a safe exit. |
| Pending | `completed-held-or-aborted-cycle-lineage` | Prevent duplicate action, retain the exact target, and announce progress without moving focus. |
| Success | `completed-held-or-aborted-cycle-lineage` | Confirm the exact outcome, preserve selection, and provide the next valid action or recovery. |
| Stale / conflict | `lockage-direction-operating-authority-and-equipment-version` | Keep the last safe value, identify the version or time conflict, and require explicit recovery. |
| Focus transition | `completed-held-or-aborted-cycle-lineage` | Move focus only to a modal or required error summary, then return it to the exact trigger. |
| Responsive presentation | `navigation-lock-control` | Preserve state, selection, query, pending result, and recovery when topology changes. |

## Boundaries

### Accept

- Accept when the dominant task is: Transit one selected vessel group between unequal water levels by controlling a navigation lock's chamber, gates and filling or emptying valves, permitting each movement only after occupancy, mooring, hydraulic-head and equipment interlocks prove it safe.
- Accept when every required region and relationship in the graph is necessary to complete the task.
- Accept when compact preserves task, state, and recovery through a replacement topology instead of stacking desktop boxes.

### Reject

- Reject `guided-setup-checklist`; this is `AR-NLCICC-90` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `workflow-automation-builder`; this is `AR-NLCICC-91` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `railway-movement-authority-control-console`; this is `AR-NLCICC-92` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.
- Reject `reservoir-release-rule-curve-coordinator`; this is `AR-NLCICC-93` evidence and must route to an adjacent archetype.

### Boundary verdict

Return `accept` only when the dominant task, complete graph, and compact parity all hold. Differences limited to noun, density, color, component, card count, or state are `duplicate-or-variation`.

## Handoff

- **Grammar handoff:** Bind product-specific owners, labels, permitted actions, and truthful state meaning to the declared regions.
- **Principles handoff:** Resolve exact grid, measure, gap, alignment, sticky offset, bounded overflow, and relationship-driven transition points.
- Neither handoff may remove a required region, change the dominant task, or weaken interaction parity.
