# Tokens

## LOADS

| Alias | Target | Kind | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@canon-fe` | `@starci/eslint-canon-fe` | npm package | the published frontend machine this record cites |
| `@canon-fe-contracts` | `@starci/eslint-canon-fe/contracts` | npm package | the published frontend contract types this record cites |


## Record

The input to this pattern is a shape somebody already accepted — a layout, a block, a surface, a
control, a status mark. That decision is closed here; this file does not reopen it. The output is
source architecture: which class string may be written, which file tier may write it, which list a
new member is added to, which stylesheet must define the variable a name requests, and which
component owns a decision instead of assembling it from classes. An accepted shape says what the
screen looks like. This pattern says what the code holding it must look like.

## Law

A token is a member of a closed set. Not a value somebody agreed to prefer — a value that is the
only thing which can be typed, so a screen off the scale is not a screen that failed review, it is a
screen that failed to compile.

Most of this law is therefore held by a type, and the rest of it exists to cover the places the type
does not reach. That division is the whole shape of this module: **the union protects the table, and
the rules protect the folder the union cannot see.**

**This is binding, not advisory.** Every measurement, every colour and every control height a screen
emits has a code below. There is no value small enough to be exempt: a `size-3.5` on one glyph is
`TOKEN-3` for the same reason a raw hex fill is `TOKEN-4`. "It is only one class" is not an
exemption — it is where the last off-scale value in a real codebase survived every rule that
existed.

**The scale, as it actually is.** Six rungs for the seam between things, unevenly spaced.

| Rung | Class | Reads as |
|---|---|---|
| 4px | `gap-1` | two lines of ONE identity — a name over its handle, a figure over the word labelling it, a title over its muted subtitle, a price over the caption qualifying it |
| 8px | `gap-2` | compact horizontal peers in one functional cluster — glyph and label, peer tabs, grouped cards, or an input and its direct inline action |
| 12px | `gap-3` | owner-to-owned or independently readable local units — label to card/input, field to field, card to caption, toolbar to governed content, or unrelated groups sharing a row |
| 16px | `gap-4` | two participants that are each already a cluster — a stack over the stack beneath it, an identity cluster against the trailing fact at the far end of its row, a prompt against the action answering it, or peer cards repeating across a grid |
| 24px | `gap-6` | two blocks on a page |
| 32px | `gap-8` | the layout seam — a rail against the column beside it |

`gap-2` requires two facts at once: the peers are horizontal AND they form one functional cluster.
Fail either test and the seam is `gap-3`. Tokens are selected by relationship and grouping, never by
component name or direction. `gap-4` is selected by the participants alone: once each side is itself
composed, the seam between them out-ranks the seams inside them, in a column, a row and a grid
alike.

**There is no zero rung, and its absence is deliberate.** "Touching" and "almost touching" are not a
distinction a second author reproduces from memory, so the surface this replaced ended up spelling
one identity stack both ways. Only the 4px rung survived that, and it survived because it names a
relationship rather than an amount — the second line qualifies the first. A container that wants no
seam declares no gap class, which is a different statement from naming a rung that measures nothing.

**Insets take 16px and 24px symmetric, or 12/8 and 16/12 asymmetric.** And the relationship that
makes an unfamiliar surface decidable is visible in the table rather than asserted over it: **the
house surface carries a 16px inset around a 16px interior seam.** The edge breathes at the rhythm of
the contents, so the two are one decision and not two. An ordinary surface therefore uses `p-4`. A
joined-list surface preserves that same 16px outer edge without insetting its dividers: the vendor
surface and its content host are `p-0`, the list root is `p-0`, a single row is `p-4`, and
first/middle/last rows are respectively `px-4 pt-4 pb-3`, `px-4 py-3`, and `px-4 pt-3 pb-4`. When
the generic surface inset is enforced with `!important`, the joined-list root wins at equal cascade
strength through a semantic `data-component` selector; utility presence is insufficient, and the
proof is computed padding of `0px` on the rendered page.

**Control height has two tokens, selected by placement rather than importance.**

| Token | Placement |
|---|---|
| `sm` | Embedded action inside a row, list item, compact toolbar, card cluster or another control's local seam |
| `md` | Standalone action that owns a line or anchors a form or surface |

The `variant` axis stays independent: it says whether an action is primary, secondary, outline or
tertiary; it does not select height. A primary action may be `sm` in a compact cluster, and a
tertiary action may be `md` when it stands alone. Label length never changes the size token.

## Situation codes

Every situation this module governs carries a code, `TOKEN-<n>`. The code names the SITUATION; the
requirement column names what the source must look like once that situation is recognised. Codes are
cited from other law files and from task records, so a number is permanent even when the wording
around it changes.

| Code | Situation | What the source must look like |
|---|---|---|
| `TOKEN-1` | A layout value is needed that the vocabulary does not contain | The layout vocabulary is a closed union, so an off-scale value cannot be typed at all. Never a value patrolled by convention that the type could have refused |
| `TOKEN-2` | A value genuinely has to be ADDED to the vocabulary | A new member is added deliberately, in the named list, where the diff shows it. Never a value arriving inside a component nobody reviewed closely |
| `TOKEN-3` | A half step appears: `gap-1.5`, `py-1.5`, `size-3.5` | Whole rungs only; the nearest rung when in doubt. Never a fractional step in any family that measures |
| `TOKEN-4` | A bracketed length such as `[13px]`, or a raw colour code | A member of the vocabulary, or a semantic colour token. Never a bracketed length or a raw colour, even when it equals a rung today |
| `TOKEN-5` | Large text plus heavy weight hand-assembled into a heading | Rank comes from the component that owns tag and metrics together. Never large text plus heavy weight assembled from raw classes |
| `TOKEN-6` | A class string is written inside a leaf, or hoisted into a module constant | Rules read class strings in source, including strings hoisted into module constants. Never an assumption that the leaf folder is covered because the tiers above it are typed |
| `TOKEN-7` | A semantic colour is needed: bare mark, soft plate, or solid plate | A bare mark uses `text-*`; a plate pairs `bg-*-soft` with `text-*-soft-foreground`, or `bg-*` with `text-*-foreground`. Never a `*-soft` background token used as an ink colour |
| `TOKEN-8` | A height must be chosen for a control | Size selected from placement, variant selected from priority. Never height inferred from variant, word count, or how loud the control feels; never custom padding used to shrink a control |
| `TOKEN-9` | A class names a token the theme has not defined | The name is a union member AND the variable it requests exists in the stylesheet. Never reporting names the framework resolves itself — `screen`, `full`, `fit`, the viewport units |
| `TOKEN-10` | One experience renders both inside a local app boundary and through document-level portals | Semantic theme variables live at the common document theme hook in the app-owned global stylesheet. A local boundary may alias or consume them, never remain their only definition |

## Reading an accepted shape

1. **Read what the shape states.** It states a relationship: this seam separates two clusters, this
   surface is a joined list, this action sits inside a row, this mark is a bare success glyph, this
   figure is the rank of its card.
2. **Name what the shape does not state, and therefore does not resolve.** A shape never states a
   pixel value, a hex code, a class family, a file tier, a union member, a stylesheet variable, or a
   `variant`. Those are resolved here, by code, and a shape that seems to state one is being read as
   a picture rather than as a decision.
3. **Resolve outermost first.** The layout seam before the block seam, the block seam before the
   surface inset, the surface inset before the seam inside it — and remember the edge of a surface
   and the seam inside it are one decision, so resolving the inset resolves the interior rhythm with
   it. Only then resolve the leaf-level measurements, colours and control heights.
4. **Ask each code's question.** Is the value a non-member (`TOKEN-1`), a considered addition to the
   list (`TOKEN-2`), a fractional step (`TOKEN-3`), an arbitrary length or raw colour (`TOKEN-4`), a
   hand-rolled heading (`TOKEN-5`), a string in the folder the union cannot see (`TOKEN-6`), a colour
   used in the wrong role (`TOKEN-7`), a control height (`TOKEN-8`), or a token name whose variable
   may not exist (`TOKEN-9`), or a semantic variable exists only below a renderer sibling that also
   consumes it (`TOKEN-10`)?
5. **When two codes both match, the tier and the failure mode separate them.** The same `[13px]` is
   `TOKEN-1` inside a typed entry, where the compiler refuses it, and `TOKEN-4` inside a leaf, where
   a rule catches it. A shrunk control that also carries custom padding is both `TOKEN-8` and
   `TOKEN-4`; the originating code is `TOKEN-8`, and the arbitrary value is reported alongside it.
   Every emitted measurement, colour and control height resolves to exactly one originating code.

## `TOKEN-1` — the scale is a union, so an off-scale value cannot be typed

**Situation.** Somebody needs a seam the vocabulary does not contain, and the first reflex is to
write `gap-[13px]` and move on.

**What it emits in source.** Nothing new. The value is not written, because it is not a member of
`LayoutClassName`. The entry takes the nearest existing rung, or the work moves to `TOKEN-2`.

**Recognition signs.** The value sits in a typed entry, not in a leaf. The compiler is red before
anyone opens the review. No rule has to say anything about it at all.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-4`: same value shape, different tier and different holder — in a typed
entry the compiler refuses, in a leaf the union cannot reach and a rule catches it. Not `TOKEN-2`:
`TOKEN-1` says the value cannot be typed; `TOKEN-2` says what to do if it must become typeable.

**Common business situations.** Building the entry for a new card · porting an old screen up into
the entry tier · widening a seam somebody called cramped · taking a contribution from someone new to
the repository.

## `TOKEN-2` — adding a member changes the scale, and must read that way

**Situation.** The vocabulary is genuinely missing something. The correct move is not to dodge the
union but to open it deliberately, in the named list, where the diff shows it.

**What it emits in source.** One diff in the vocabulary list itself — the union of literals — with
the comment above it honoured: grow this list deliberately, so the addition reads as a decision. No
change at any call site introduces the member.

**Recognition signs.** The need repeats across screens, not in one place. Whoever adds it can name
the relationship the new rung names, not only its measurement. The change lives in the vocabulary
list, not inside a component.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-1`, which is the refusal itself. Not `TOKEN-3`: a half step is never a
candidate member, because the scale is whole rungs unevenly spaced, so a half step does not sit
between two rungs — it sits outside the scale.

**Common business situations.** Adding a container breakpoint · adding an inset for a new kind of
surface · absorbing a parallel union that grew in another repository and must be merged back.

## `TOKEN-3` — a half step is not between two rungs, it is off the scale

**Situation.** An `x.5` value appears in any family that measures: `gap`, `p`, `m`, `space`, `size`,
`w`, `h`, `inset` and their edges.

**What it emits in source.** A whole rung — the nearest one when in doubt. The `FRACTIONAL` pattern
and the `noFractionalStep` rule built from it hold this in product source.

**Recognition signs.** The value carries a decimal point. It is justified with "the other one was a
touch tight". A product-wide search finds no second use of the same value.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-4`: `size-3.5` is a fractional step, `size-[14px]` is an arbitrary value.
They draw the same thing and fail in two different ways, so they are two codes. Not `TOKEN-2`: a
half step is not a proposal for a new member.

**Common business situations.** Aligning a glyph to a line of text · nudging a badge off an overlap ·
shrinking a control into a tight row · porting an odd measurement straight off a design image.

## `TOKEN-4` — an arbitrary value leaves the system, whatever it equals

**Situation.** A bracketed length, or a raw colour code. Chosen once, by one person, for one screen.

**What it emits in source.** A member of the vocabulary for a measurement, or a semantic colour
token for a colour. `ARBITRARY_LENGTH`, `RAW_COLOUR` and the two message ids in `noArbitraryValue`
hold this — one message for `length`, one for `colour`.

**Recognition signs.** `[...]` in a measuring class, or `#` in a colour class. It may be exactly
equal to a rung today — and that is the trap. Nobody finds it by consulting the scale, and it does
not move when the scale moves.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-1`: same value shape, different tier, different holder. Not `TOKEN-7`:
`text-[#16a34a]` is a raw colour, while `text-success-soft` on a bare mark is a semantic colour used
in the wrong role — one stands outside the palette, the other stands inside it wearing the wrong
role. Not `TOKEN-9`: `max-w-[64rem]` is arbitrary; `max-w-app-lg` with no variable defined is
unresolved. Both are broken, but only one looks correct.

**Common business situations.** Matching a brand colour taken from a design file · pinning a sidebar
width · tuning a shadow to "look like the mock" · patching a text overflow in a hurry.

## `TOKEN-5` — rank comes from the type scale, not from a hand-assembled pair

**Situation.** Large text plus heavy weight. That IS a heading, whatever tag carries it.

**What it emits in source.** The heading leaf, where `level` drives tag and metrics as one decision.
`LARGE_TEXT` and `HEAVY_WEIGHT` tested together are what `noHandRolledHeading` looks for.

**Recognition signs.** A `span` or `div` carrying both a large size class and a bold weight class. It
reads as a heading by eye and does not exist in the outline. When the type scale changes, this place
is left behind.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-4`: `TOKEN-5` says nothing about whether the values are on the scale —
`text-2xl` and `font-bold` are both valid members; the fault is combining them here. Not `TOKEN-1`:
the union cannot save this code, because both classes are members. What is lost is not the type size
but the document structure, and structure does not appear in a screenshot.

**Common business situations.** A heading in an empty state · a large figure on a stat card · a
course name on a card · a title inside a modal · the heading of a section added in a hurry.

## `TOKEN-6` — the rule exists for the folder the union cannot see

**Situation.** Every tier above the leaf takes its classes from a typed entry, so the union already
holds them. The leaf writes its own classes and is exempt from entry law by policy — so it is the
one place an off-scale value can still be typed.

**What it emits in source.** A reader that covers the whole folder: `isSourceFile` and the
`VariableDeclarator` branch of `classTextVisitors` implement it, and `LEAF_DIR_RELATIVE` /
`isLeafFile` name the exempt folder. Nothing reports a violation of this code — no rule can fail when
coverage is missing, so the gap is invisible from the outside.

**Recognition signs.** The file sits in the leaf folder. The class is written directly in markup, or
hoisted into a module constant. A rule that only walks JSX attributes looks straight through that
constant.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-3` and not `TOKEN-4`: those two say which value is wrong; `TOKEN-6` says
where a rule must look to see it at all. Without `TOKEN-6` those two miss exactly the folder they
were written to cover. Not `TOKEN-1`: `TOKEN-1` covers the entry tier and `TOKEN-6` covers its
complement; only together are they closed. Hoisting to a constant is concealment, not permission —
the last off-scale value in the codebase these rules were written for lived in exactly such a
constant.

**Common business situations.** Adding a new leaf · collecting repeated classes into a `const` for
tidiness · writing a `TONE_CLASSES` or `SIZE_CLASSES` table · reviewing a PR by reading only the JSX.

## `TOKEN-7` — a semantic colour is paired with the surface carrying it

**Situation.** There are three roles, not one. A bare mark uses `text-success`. A soft plate pairs
`bg-success-soft` with `text-success-soft-foreground`. A solid plate pairs `bg-success` with
`text-success-foreground`. Warning and danger follow the same three roles.

**What it emits in source.** A tone table that pairs `bg-*-soft` with `text-*-soft-foreground`, and
a bare mark that uses plain `text-success`. Nothing mechanical holds this: pairing is a two-class
relationship no rule in the token rule file looks for.

**Recognition signs.** A `-soft` token standing in a text-colour position. A bare glyph borrowing a
colour meant to be a background. Readable in one theme and losing contrast in the other.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-4`: `TOKEN-7` is the right palette in the wrong role, `TOKEN-4` is outside
the palette entirely. Not `TOKEN-1`: the union can accept both names, because both are valid tokens.
What is wrong is the pair, and a pair is not a member.

**Common business situations.** A completion tick in a daily quest · an order-status badge · a
payment-deadline warning line · a "Log out" item tinted danger in a menu · a form error box.

## `TOKEN-8` — size follows placement, variant follows priority

**Situation.** Choosing a height for a button. There are only two tokens, and both name a
reproducible relationship: `sm` is an action embedded in a row, list item, compact toolbar or card
cluster; `md` is an action that stands alone, owning a line or anchoring a form.

**What it emits in source.** `export type ButtonSize = "sm" | "md"` and the comment stating size
follows placement, independently of visual priority. The size union closes the set to two, so a
third height is unrepresentable — but WHICH of the two is right is a placement judgement nothing
checks.

**Recognition signs.** The same role changes geometry between two screens. The height is inferred
from "this button matters more". Custom padding appears in order to shrink a control.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-4`: custom padding used to shrink a control usually drags in a half step or
a bracketed value, so two codes fire at once and the originating code is still `TOKEN-8`. Not
`TOKEN-1`: the size set is closed at two, so a third height cannot be typed — but picking the wrong
one of the two still can, which is why this code sits at `documented`. Label length never changes the
size token: a long-labelled button is still an embedded button if it is embedded.

**Common business situations.** A reaction button in an activity row · an "Apply" button beside a
discount-code field · the submit button of a signup form · a "See all" button in the corner of a
card · an action cluster in a toolbar.

## `TOKEN-9` — a class naming a token means nothing until the theme defines it

**Situation.** `max-w-app-lg` is not a width. It is a request sent to the variable
`--container-app-lg`. When that variable does not exist, the class is still emitted, the element
still renders, and nothing is red.

**What it emits in source.** A name that is a union member AND a stylesheet that defines the
variable it requests — `TOKEN_CLASS_FAMILIES` and `TAILWIND_OWN_NAMES` on the rule side, the
`--container-app-*` variables the `max-w-app-*` names request on the theme side. Held by
`no-unresolved-token-class`.

**Recognition signs.** The class name reads like a house token, in a family whose variable name can
be derived. The union accepts the name, so the compiler is satisfied. The page silently loses its
measurement.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-1`: this is the one dead value the union cannot catch, and it is worse than
a genuine off-scale value for that reason — an off-scale value does not compile, while this one
passes every gate and reaches production. Not `TOKEN-4`: an arbitrary value stands outside the
system while this one looks correct. Names the framework resolves itself are out of scope: `screen`,
`full`, `fit`, `auto`, `none`, `min`, `max`, `prose`, `px` and the viewport units promise nothing
about this theme, and reporting them sends an author to define a variable nothing reads — measured
across two repositories on the first run: two findings, both wrong, both from this list.

**Common business situations.** Renaming a container token · deleting a theme variable believed
unused · copying a layout entry to another app in the monorepo · standing up a new app and forgetting
to copy the theme.

## `TOKEN-10` — one theme owner must reach every renderer root in the experience

**Situation.** The app places semantic colour variables under a local visual boundary while a vendor
menu, drawer, popover or overlay is rendered as that boundary's document sibling. The variable exists,
so `TOKEN-9` is satisfied inside the app, but the portalled surface falls back to vendor colour.

**What it emits in source.** Define the semantic palette and light/dark hooks in the app-owned global
stylesheet at the nearest document ancestor shared by routed content and renderer-owned portals. A local
theme boundary may alias grammar roles, set typography or consume the palette; components and mechanics
branches never duplicate raw colours to repair one portal.

**Recognition signs.** Routed content has the expected accent while a dropdown or drawer is blue; dark
mode changes the document ground but leaves a local boundary transparent or on light content roles; a
component-level selector repairs one overlay while another portal still falls back.

**Boundary.** Not `TOKEN-9`: every variable may exist and still be scoped below one consumer, so the
unresolved-token gate stays green. Not `VENDOR-2`: the mechanics branch may correctly own portal lifecycle;
`TOKEN-10` owns where the semantic variables it consumes must be reachable. An intentionally isolated embed
with its own declared theme owner is outside this code.

**Common business situations.** Account dropdown · locale menu · modal · drawer · tooltip · toast rendered
outside the local app subtree · dark-mode dashboard whose body and content boundary disagree.

## Layer held

Which tier actually holds each code. A rule is named only where one was found in `tokens.mjs` and
read; everything else is `documented`, and that gap is a measurement, not a failure.

| Code | Tier | What holds it |
|---|---|---|
| `TOKEN-1` | `unrepresentable` | The closed `LayoutClassName` union. `gap-[13px]` is not refused; it is not a member |
| `TOKEN-2` | `documented` | Nothing mechanical. A union can refuse a non-member; it cannot judge whether a new member was a considered decision |
| `TOKEN-3` | `enforced` | `no-fractional-step` |
| `TOKEN-4` | `enforced` | `no-arbitrary-value` (two messages: `length` and `colour`) |
| `TOKEN-5` | `enforced` | `no-hand-rolled-heading` |
| `TOKEN-6` | `documented` | Nothing reports a violation of it. `isSourceFile` and the `VariableDeclarator` visitor in `tokens.mjs` IMPLEMENT it; no rule can fail when coverage is missing |
| `TOKEN-7` | `documented` | Nothing mechanical. Pairing is a two-class relationship no rule in `tokens.mjs` looks for |
| `TOKEN-8` | `documented` | The size union closes the set to two, so a third height is unrepresentable — but WHICH of the two is right is a placement judgement nothing checks |
| `TOKEN-9` | `enforced` | `no-unresolved-token-class` |
| `TOKEN-10` | `documented` | Browser computed-style proof across routed content and one renderer-owned portal; no published static rule proves cascade reach |

Four codes are `enforced`, one is `unrepresentable`, five are `documented`. The vocabulary type owns
the entry tier and the leaf folder stays outside it by policy; the rule file owns product source
under `src/`, and tooling and configuration stay ignorant of all of it because they render nothing.

## Anchor

Where each code can be checked against real code. Paths are repository-relative: `starci-eslint/packages/fe/…` is
this trust tree, `src/…` is a consuming front-end repository.

| Code | Anchor | What to look for |
|---|---|---|
| `TOKEN-1` | `@canon-fe-contracts` · `components/contracts/index.ts` | `export type LayoutClassName` — a union of literals with the six gap rungs among them |
| `TOKEN-2` | `@canon-fe-contracts` | The comment above the union: grow this list deliberately, so the addition reads as a decision in the diff |
| `TOKEN-3` | `@canon-fe` | The `FRACTIONAL` pattern and the `noFractionalStep` rule built from it |
| `TOKEN-4` | `@canon-fe` | `ARBITRARY_LENGTH`, `RAW_COLOUR`, and the two message ids in `noArbitraryValue` |
| `TOKEN-5` | `@canon-fe` · `components/leaves/Heading/index.tsx` | `LARGE_TEXT` and `HEAVY_WEIGHT` tested together; and the leaf where `level` drives tag and metrics as one decision |
| `TOKEN-6` | `@canon-fe` · `@canon-fe` | `isSourceFile`, the `VariableDeclarator` branch of `classTextVisitors`; and `LEAF_DIR_RELATIVE` / `isLeafFile`, which name the exempt folder |
| `TOKEN-7` | `components/leaves/IconTile/index.tsx` · `components/leaves/RankDeltaCaret/index.tsx` | A tone table pairing `bg-*-soft` with `text-*-soft-foreground`; and a bare mark using plain `text-success` |
| `TOKEN-8` | `components/leaves/Button/index.tsx` | `export type ButtonSize = "sm" \| "md"` and the comment stating size follows placement, independently of visual priority |
| `TOKEN-9` | `@canon-fe` · `app/globals.css` | `TOKEN_CLASS_FAMILIES` and `TAILWIND_OWN_NAMES`; and the `--container-app-*` variables the `max-w-app-*` names request |
| `TOKEN-10` | `app/globals.css` · a named mechanics portal branch | Document theme hooks define the semantic palette once; computed style in routed content and the portalled surface resolves the same accent and mode pair |
| inset pairing | `app/globals.css` · `components/branches/SurfaceListCard/index.tsx` | `.card { padding: calc(var(--spacing) * 4) !important }` beside `.card[data-component="SurfaceListCardSurface"] { padding: 0 !important }` — the equal-strength semantic exception |
| joined-list rows | `components/contracts/index.ts` | Entries carrying `p-0`, `[&>*]:px-4`, `[&>*]:py-3`, `[&>*:first-child]:pt-4`, `[&>*:last-child]:pb-4` |

The last two rows anchor decisions the flat law made in prose without giving them a number. They are
listed here so the decisions stay checkable; they are not new codes.

## Inputs

| Input | Evidence required |
|---|---|
| class string | The literal text, whether written in markup, hoisted into a module constant, or listed in an entry array |
| tier | Which folder the file sits in — typed entry tier, or the leaf folder that writes its own classes |
| vocabulary | The current union members, read from the union itself and not from memory |
| theme | The stylesheet that defines the variables a token name requests, plus every renderer root that consumes those variables |
| placement | For a control: embedded in a row or cluster, versus standalone and owning a line |
| role | For a colour: bare mark, soft plate, or solid plate |

## Render-contract opt-in tokens

The closed default scale remains unchanged. A schema 6 render contract may select the typed local variants
`Heading.scale="display"`, `Text size="metric-lead"` and `Button size="lg"`; leaf-owned variant tables emit their
tokens. `lg` is restricted to a standalone page-root primary CTA, while row/card/toolbar actions remain `sm` or
`md`. Call sites may not write new utilities or arbitrary values to approximate any opt-in.

## Rules

1. An off-scale layout value is unrepresentable, not merely refused.
2. A new member of the vocabulary is a diff in the named list, never a value introduced at a call
   site.
3. No measurement takes a fractional step, in any family.
4. No bracketed length and no raw colour appears in product source, whatever it evaluates to.
5. Rank is emitted by the component that owns tag and metrics together, never assembled from
   classes.
6. A rule that reads class strings reads constants as well as markup.
7. A background token is never used as a foreground token.
8. Size comes from placement and variant comes from priority; the two axes never select each other.
9. A class naming a theme token resolves only when the stylesheet defines its variable.
10. The edge of a surface and the seam inside it are one decision.
11. Every emitted measurement, colour and control height resolves to exactly one code.
12. Semantic theme variables consumed by routed content and renderer-owned portals live at their common
    document theme hook in the app-owned global stylesheet; a local boundary is never their only owner.

## Exceptions

Exceptions are part of the rule, not relief from it. Each is closed and cites the code it applies to.

- **Positional selectors in an entry.** `TOKEN-1` admits `[&>*]:px-4`-shaped members inside the
  entry table and nowhere else, because a joined list must inset its rows without insetting the
  dividers between them.
- **Names the framework resolves itself.** `TOKEN-9` does not apply to `screen`, `full`, `fit`,
  `auto`, `none`, `min`, `max`, `prose`, `px` or the viewport units. They promise nothing about this
  theme, and reporting them sends an author to define a variable nothing reads.
- **No stylesheet found.** `TOKEN-9` stays silent rather than calling every token dead. A reader
  that cannot find the theme has no evidence, and no evidence is not a finding.
- **Product source only.** `TOKEN-3`, `TOKEN-4`, `TOKEN-5` and `TOKEN-9` read files under `src/`.
  Tooling and configuration are out of scope, because they render nothing.
- **Equal cascade strength.** Where a generic inset is enforced with `!important`, `TOKEN-1`'s
  preference for utilities yields to a semantic `data-component` selector — a utility cannot beat an
  important declaration, and the proof of the exception is computed padding on the rendered page.
- **State parity.** Holding across every code: skeleton and real content share every token. Changing
  an inset or a control size while loading is a lie about the relationship, and it makes the layout
  jump when the data arrives.

## Output

One block per file the accepted shape produces, and one block per value inside that file that this
pattern resolves.

```text
value: <the class or token as written>
tier: <entry | leaf>
code: <TOKEN-1 … TOKEN-10>
holder: <unrepresentable | enforced:<rule-name> | documented>
verdict: <member | replace with <member> | define <variable> | pair with <token>>
reason: <the fact that excludes the adjacent code>
```

## Worked example

**The accepted shape.** A surface holding a joined list of rows; each row carries an identity cluster
on the left, a small success mark, and an "Apply" action embedded at the trailing end; the surface
sits in a column constrained to the large app container.

The shape states relationships only. It does not state the pixel value of the row inset, the hex of
the success mark, the height of the action, the file tier any of these live in, or whether the theme
defines the container variable — so none of those are resolved by the shape, and all of them are
resolved here.

Entry file, `components/contracts/index.ts`:

```text
value: p-0
tier: entry
code: TOKEN-1
holder: unrepresentable
verdict: member
reason: the surface is a joined list, so the outer 16px edge is carried by the rows, not by an inset that would also inset the dividers
```

```text
value: [&>*]:px-4
tier: entry
code: TOKEN-1
holder: unrepresentable
verdict: member
reason: a positional selector in the entry table is the closed exception to TOKEN-1, so this is not the arbitrary-value situation of TOKEN-4
```

```text
value: max-w-app-lg
tier: entry
code: TOKEN-9
holder: enforced:no-unresolved-token-class
verdict: define --container-app-lg
reason: the name is a union member, so the compiler is satisfied — which excludes TOKEN-1 and leaves only the missing stylesheet variable
```

Leaf file, `components/leaves/StatusMark/index.tsx`:

```text
value: text-success
tier: leaf
code: TOKEN-7
holder: documented
verdict: member
reason: the mark is bare, with no plate behind it, which excludes the bg/foreground pairing and excludes TOKEN-4 because the token is in the palette
```

```text
value: size-3.5
tier: leaf
code: TOKEN-3
holder: enforced:no-fractional-step
verdict: replace with size-4
reason: the value is a half step rather than a bracketed length, which is what separates it from TOKEN-4
```

Leaf file, `components/leaves/Button/index.tsx`:

```text
value: sm
tier: leaf
code: TOKEN-8
holder: documented
verdict: member
reason: the action is embedded at the trailing end of a row, and placement alone selects the height — its priority does not, which excludes any variant-driven reading
```

## Scope

This rule holds for any code of this kind in this stack: any front end that closes its class
vocabulary in a type. It names no product, no feature and no component library. Every example is
ordinary TSX with ordinary class strings. The Anchor table cites repository-relative paths as
EVIDENCE that the law is checkable — those paths are not part of the vocabulary the law defines.
